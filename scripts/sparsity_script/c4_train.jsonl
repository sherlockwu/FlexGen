{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "We held a public exhibition earlier this month to consult with members of the local community regarding the proposed development of up to 130 high-quality houses in Eccleshall. Attended by over 140 members of the community, including local residents, Parish Councillors and businesses, we were able to hear concerns of how the proposed development on Stafford Road, to the rear of Badgers Croft, would affect the local community.\n• The proposed vehicle through-route from Stafford Road to Badgers Croft.\n• Whether the benefits of the affordable housing would be for local people.\n• The effects on the town’s infrastructure, including the capacity of sewerage networks and local schools.\n• The impact on the amenity and views for existing residents living on Badgers Croft and Stafford Road.\nWe are now responding to feedback by addressing the issues raised through proposed amendments to the proposal, which it will present at the Eccleshall Parish Council Planning Meeting to be held at the Broughton Parish Rooms on Wednesday 16th April.\n• No vehicle access through to Badgers Croft. Badgers Croft will therefore only be used for pedestrian and cyclist access, so that existing and new residents can easily and safely access the new public play space and open spaces.\n• The main point of access from Stafford Road is now proposed as a roundabout solution, which will have wider safety benefits for existing residents by slowing speeds on this stretch of road.\n• Plans include first refusal on affordable housing for local residents and family members of Eccleshall Parish, which is not a standard approach in the industry, but means that the needs of local people are met before these properties are offered to other people from nearby parishes or the wider Borough.\nPaul Campbell, director of Richborough Estates said: “We have listened carefully to the feedback from local people in Eccleshall and have revised our proposed plans to make sure they take into account the feedback we have received and to ensure that they are genuinely beneficial to people living in the town.\nIf the proposed development is approved, it will deliver much needed new market and affordable housing in key services villages as outlined in the emerging Plan for Stafford Borough. This will include a mix of housing types, ranging from affordable bungalows to two bedroom starter homes andfive bed family homes.\nA total of 40% of the development, or up to 52 dwellings, will be affordable housing. We will also be responsible for making any necessary improvements to the community infrastructure, such as educational, highways and other improvements as deemed fit by the local authority and the Parish Council’s Neighbourhood Planning Group."}

There is so much to love here, from landscape and wildlife to a rural culture and history inextricably linked to the land; I wanted a part in looking after it all.\nWhat is your earliest memory of the Lake District?\nBraithwaite was the perfect village to be a kid in the '70s. We had the freedom to run wild, with becks and hills as our playground. Lots of happy memories!\nI enjoy meeting great people, exploring some less walked bits of the park, testing my navigation and mountain skills and witnessing lightbulb moments as others develop their own skills and confidence.\nWhat is your favourite spot in the Lake District and why?\nMy favourite spot is wherever I am/have just been!\nWhich is your favourite Lake or Fell and why?\nEnnerdale Water because it is less visited than many others and has no lakeshore road/traffic. And Haycock Fell because of a memorable camp on the top, with some sheep that fancied stampeding around the tent at random intervals all through the night before disappearing again; I’m pretty sure they were laughing at me.\nTell us an interesting fact or anecdote you would like to share about the Lake District?\nI also volunteer with Kendal Mountain Search and Rescue Team. When out and about, be reassured that there are around 400 volunteer members, including me, of the 12 Mountain Rescue Teams, who are on call 24/7/365 to come to your aid.

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "Fresh produce and locally made food items just got a lot more accessible for Western Michigan University students and faculty. The Local Global Market is officially happening on campus in front of Sangren Hall every Wednesday, 10am-2pm with its last day on October 25th. The market is put on through a partnership between PFC Markets and the International Student Activities Office. Instead of students making the trek out to the Kalamazoo Farmers Market, or perhaps even traveling all the way to Portage, they have the convenience of accessing the Market on their home base. Fresh produce isn't the only food available either; there are freshly made cookies, homemade granola, gelato, cold-brew coffee, and much more.\nChristina, a student at WMU, discusses why she appreciates the Market being on campus: \"I love how it comes to me while I'm available at school. I'm in class or at work during other Farmers Markets, so this is just so convenient. It's also a great opportunity for kids who live in dorms and don't have cars.\" Christina's favorite items she likes to buy are pears, apples, the \"massive\" cinnamon rolls, and the hot pepper mustard from LT's Angry Mustard. \"I have to buy extra and hide it from my boyfriend because we go through it so fast,\" she jokes.\nStudents aren't the only ones who approve of the Market being on campus. Nabe, the main farmer and forager from Bonamego Farms loves coming to WMU every Wednesday. She says she likes being on campus because it provides a change of environment and she appreciates seeing young people buying local food. Nabe enjoys giving students \"tips and tricks\" to preparing some of the items she has for sale that students may not know how to cook or eat, like paw paw fruit and ground cherries.\nThe WMU's Office of Sustainability is also a big supporter of the Farmers Market coming to campus. Daniel, the Crops Coordinator for Gibbs House (a fellowship program from the Office of Sustainability) says he likes how easy it is for students to access fresh, local and healthy food. Gibbs House also sells their own sustainably grown produce alongside other farmers at the Market, but Daniel says mostly their goal is to try to educate students on sustainability programs and lifestyles they can get involved in at WMU.\nBringing local, fresh and sustainably-made produce and food products right to campus is a fantastic way to get students more involved with the local Kalamazoo food community. Stop by every Wednesday from 10am-2pm located in front of Sangren Hall to see for yourself!"}

And you immigrated to the United States, right?\nORTEGA: Yes, I did. My parents brought me here when I had just turned two years old. I turned two years old December of 1986 and I got here in January of 1988.\nSERRANO: Okay, well let's start from the beginning. So, tell us about your life in Mexico.\nORTEGA: My life in Mexico, well there's a lot of stories my parents have told me. When I was born, I was born in December 1986. What I've heard the most about my birth is that I was born a very sick baby. I would cry a lot, I would get very high fevers, et cetera. And then my parents decided to take me to the doctor because nothing was helping me. So, on New Year,s Eve of that same year, I was what, like a month old, I got a really bad seizure. And my grandma thought I was gonna die. And after that, everything seemed fine. I don't know, in the Latino culture, your parents or your grandparents go to the Virgin María or, you know, like la Virgin de Guadalupe. Like, “¡Ayúdame!” So my grandma made a petition for me and all of a sudden I got good. So then after that, babies start developing, walking, talking, et cetera. My parents always told me I talk a lot, ever since I was a baby, so pretty much, I started talking but I wasn't walking. That's when things started getting weird.\nSERRANO: Okay, so what part of Mexico are you from? Are you coming from?\nORTEGA: I am from León, Guanajuato.\nSERRANO: Okay, tell me a little bit a little bit about your family, your parents.\nORTEGA: My parents are, you know, very hard-working, you know, Latinos mexicanos. You know, my mom is a stay-at-home mother. My dad works construction, you know. Very hard, we almost don't see him all summer because he's always working. You know, they've always been very supportive of me. Tried to push me forward, trying to make me, you know, a good human being and you know, so far they've done what they can to, like, you know.\nSERRANO: So, you came with them when you guys came to the United States?\nORTEGA: My grandpa, but brought all his children, you know, to Chicago and she had already lived here part of her life, but then they went back when she was 16 and that's where she met my dad. So, she brought my dad over here. And they started this whole journey.\nSERRANO: Oh, okay. That's cool.\nSERRANO: Do you think it would have been different if you would have stayed in Mexico?\nORTEGA: I think about it a lot of the time and who knows how my life would have been? I know that my family, you know, it's very different being disabled here and, unfortunately, being disabled in Mexico because a lot of people, they still get very scared if they see you can't do certain things as other people. They don't know how to react. So, I honestly don't know. I feel like, as far as my family makes me feel, I don't think I would have ever been different, like, in their eyes, but I do think, like, as you know, maybe growing up and, like, you know, getting, like, a job would have been, like, very hard for me. Because my parents decided to move back to Mexico when I was about 10 years old, nine, ten years old, and I noticed, like such a difference. You know here, unfortunately, like I mean not unfortunately here, but here, you got all the care you needed since you were a child. You know, if you needed help, you know, like the person who helps you, helps you, but they don't baby you. And as soon as I got to Mexico, it was a cultural impact because I didn't know, like, a word of Spanish. I spoke English in the household. Like all my life, since kindergarten, I was in English; no bilingual and I only knew the Spanish my parents would, you know, speak to me and then I got over there. I didn't know any Spanish, you know. My teachers, you know, they're not educated to deal with, like, disabilities. So, it was, it was a bit, you know, depressing. It was super hard for me. So, it makes me think, \"What if I would have stayed over there? How would my life would have been?\" I think it would have been twice as hard as it is here.\nORTEGA: As far as, you know, it's unfortunate. I don't know. I haven't been to Mexico in, what, 15 years now, so maybe things have changed. But as far as when I got over there, back in 1994, what I noticed was there was a lot of isolation, you know, for me. I think my mom, you know, she had to, like fight, fight for me in a way like to make teachers see me as normal as they could. Yeah, because I you know, my disability. It's my walking impairment. So they, you know, like sometimes I couldn't run as fast as the kids. Like my teacher would just tell me, \"No, no. Sit here. Like for gym class. He wouldn't let me out for recess. He's like, \"Oh, I don't want to get sued.\" And you know, that would make me feel like really bad. So, my mom would, like, kind of like every week, she would have, like, a meeting with the teachers in Mexico. So I don't know. Maybe things have changed now. You know, 15 years is a long time. I don't want to speak, you know, bad about, like, my country or, you know, about the people that live there but...I'm not saying they're bad people. They're just not educated. And I think, you know, disabilities, it's still a taboo. So yeah.\nSERRANO: Okay. Well, that's good. Um, when you when you guys crossed the border, you guys came directly to Chicago?\nORTEGA: From what I remember, the first time we went to...what was it? Ciudad Juarez and stayed with like a lady. And then, yeah, we took the plane to Chicago and we got here. I just remember it being really cold.\nORTEGA: Yeah, but from what...that's from what I hear, like, from my parents, you know? The second time we crossed the border in Tamaulipas. Like yeah, and we crossed the border to Texas. I forgot what part of Texas. You know, Texas is really big. But yeah, we crossed the border there and then my aunt and uncle came to pick to pick me, my mom, and my brother up and we drove to Chicago.\nSERRANO: Okay. And had you guys moved a lot in Chicago or were you guys in the same place most of your life?\nSERRANO: So, what was your experience in elementary school? Like, like, you know how you were telling me like your disability and was it almost the same, too, over here or did, like, the teachers give you more opportunity to, you know, go out to recess or be like the other kids?\nORTEGA: Oh, here. Definitely here. I think I was even pushed more to my boundaries. I've always been a very independent, you know, child and I think that comes from my mother. My mother has never treated me as you know, \"You have a disability\" or, \"You can't do that.\" Maybe sometimes, you know, with like, \"No, it might be dangerous. Don't go out too late.\" But as far as like doing chores, she's like, \"No. Do the dishes.\" But when I got here from elementary school, it was very different. I had, like, this little this person who was helping me, my aide. And since my grammar school didn't have elevators—because it was already sixth grade. So it was middle school. So, he would walk with me up and down the stairs. Or, like, he would take my book bag. So they would never tell me, \"No, you can't take the stairs.\" No, they would, like, push me to take the stairs. You know, I think what made me feel different this time was that I wasn't such a little girl anymore. I was growing up.\nORTEGA: And back when, you know, I was in 6th grade, which was in the 90s, there was still a lot of bullying. You know, now they've put it out like, \"Oh, stop bullying.\"\nSERRANO: It's a big issue now.\nORTEGA: It's a big issue now. Like you see it everywhere. I wish they would campaign for it back then because I was bullied a lot in grammar school. And I think that's what made it hard. You know, they were like, \"Oh, you walk slow,\" you know, kids were mean.\nORTEGA: Um, but I think it's helped me, like, become the person I am today. I, you know, I don't let myself down. I tried to impress myself as much as I can. You know if somebody tells me, \"Oh, you probably can't do that.\" I try to prove them wrong and maybe it's bad sometimes, but that's what I do.\nSERRANO: What's the thing that motivated you to be better, not let them put you down?\nORTEGA: You know, being a disabled person and a Latina, it's always hard. Especially, like, looking for jobs. I think when I started looking for a jobs. I think that's what gave me, like, my thick skin. You know, grammar school, I would cry a lot to my mom like, \"Oh, they're bullying me. They tell me things.\" You know, I was, like, very naive. I would just cry and, you know, as soon as I got to high school, it was like a different thing. I was so like...I don't know. I feel like when you get to high school, well, at least for me, I was a happy person. You know, you're not only dealing with, like, disabled people. You're also dealing with like, you know, oh, you know, this person just came out. They're gay. So, you just like meet so many new kids. It's like, \"Oh, I'm not the only different one.\" Like it's not so much, like, you don't see the same group every day, especially since I went to a public school that had like six hundred freshmen. And yeah, but what motivated me was when I started getting jobs and like internships, I went to an interview for an internship at Radio Arte because I wanted to, you know...Radio Arte was a local radio station in Pilsen and they would offer free classes for communications as far as, you know, radio broadcasting. And I really wanted to do that. And I think I started, like, becoming tough from there because I know I went to my interview and I felt really confident about it. And I didn't get picked and I was so devastated. Like I told my parents, \"I don't understand why it didn't get picked for this program. Like it seems, like, you know... the professor liked me and we got along,\" you know. But, \"What's wrong with me?\" And I was just pretty upset like the whole weekend. On Monday night, I got a phone call from the professor and she's like, \"Oh Barbara, I just wanted to say that I do want to put you in the program, but I don't know. Do you need any accommodations? Because we can't give you accommodations and we have, like, so many stairs. So that's why we didn't put your name on the list because we didn't know if we could help you.\" And I was like, \"Well, yeah. I mean, maybe I'm a bit slower, but that doesn't stop me from, like, wanting to learn and, you know, and wanting to get to class on time et cetera.\" So she's like, \"Well, before I put your name on the list, I wanted to confirm with you that you were okay taking steps.\" And I'm like, \"Yes, I'm fine,\" you know. And that's when I started, like, seeing kind of like, you know, it wasn't...I don't think they saw it as discrimination, but. you do...You know, as much as job forms say \"we don't discriminate against disabilities, race, religion,\" sometimes I do feel like it can be like that. You know, I love makeup. I want to be a successful makeup artist and, you know, I don't know can we disclose companies or no?\nSERRANO: Go ahead. No, go ahead.\nORTEGA: I went to this interview with this, like, company and you know, I'm not trying to say, \"Oh, I have the best personality,\" but I think I have what it takes to like, you know, bring people in. But I you know, I feel like, I feel like sometimes I have to work harder because they—you know, managers—don't know when they interview you on the phone. You know, how you walk or how you're going to walk in. So they're like, \"Oh, okay.\" Like, they see you and it's like...it's crazy. Like you have to make yourself known even more and you have to prove them that you're strong because if not, I think if you don't do that...It's a bit harder for people with disabilities to get a job. You know, I used to work for Olive Garden a few years back and I heard a lot of rumors. I had my interview sitting down and my boss hired me on the spot. And I came back for my training the following week and the general manager. was upset with my boss because, because he said, \"How could she hire me when she didn't even know that I couldn't do the job.\" But then after four years after that when I decided to leave the company, he got upset with me because he's like, \"Oh you're leaving us,\" you know, and, \"you were one of my best, you know, hosts. One of my best employees.\" So that's why I say, \"Never judge a book by its cover.\"\nSERRANO: So you saw a lot of discrimination. Did you ever, like, encounter racism? Like either in your school or at work or anywhere?\nORTEGA: As far as racism for me, I guess maybe sometimes with schedule changes, you know. Sometimes if a manager is of a certain, you know, race, they give their own people, like, more hours. I guess that's where I know that like where I notice it from. But even as far as, like, with your own people, I think there's a lot of, you know, racism.\nSERRANO: Like if you were born in Mexico and not here or like just, nomás así.\nORTEGA: I think in general, but yeah, it has a lot to do with like, también...if, you know, a lot of people tell me that they're surprised right now. I'm...I only work with a DACA, you know, the...I'm with deferred action and a lot of people, you know, in my current job, they're like, \"Oh, well, you know, you're like, oh you're a citizen, right? Like, \"I just went to become a citizen\" and I'm like, \"No. No, I'm just working with DACA and they're like, \"Oh my God, you look like a white girl.\" And I'm no, so, yeah, I think...What is another place? Oh, yeah, actually, I had my job at Macy's for like a year. I was so happy that job. I was working with makeup, making people pretty and happy and then all of a sudden, I get a letter and it's like well if you don't you don't renew your Social Security [number] like in a month, we're gonna have to, like, let you go. And oh my God, that was like the worst month ever because you know, I was, I kept calling, like, the immigration lawyer. Like, “When am I going to get it?\" Like, \"I know I've been approved like, you know, to renew it,\" but, unfortunately, I couldn't, you know, I couldn't get it. I couldn't get the DACA on time. Like the renewed one. And they let me go. And I think I've seen a lot of, you know, cases like mine and I feel that, in a way, that is discrimination. You know, I know you need, like, a permit to work here, but at least you know, like give us time. It makes...like, everything with immigration takes time, you know. They can't give you your paperwork like one day to another and I think that's what employers need to learn. But, especially with big chains, I think that's like the saddest part, that, you know, they don't care if they lose you because you don't have like, you know, your social or your work permit renewed because they could just get people like that. So that's a big issue to me. That's where I see like that's where I'm most hurt, because that's where I see discrimination and a bit of racism. Because if you can't get...even if you prove to be the best employee, you have the perfect attendance, you have the best sales, if you don't have that Social Security renewed or, you know, that work permit renewed, you're nothing. So I think that's where I see most discrimination and that's where I feel more hurt.\nSERRANO: Do you think there should be more change and more laws, like, between that? Like the working and everything?\nORTEGA: Yeah. Um, you know, I appreciate what Obama has done with the whole DACA, deferred action. That has opened so many doors for me it. You know, it even makes me emotional at times because I've fought so hard to be, you know...I went to school. I paid out of my pocket. I got my Associate's degree. Unfortunately, I can't move past that. Yes, there's scholarships, you know, I know, and I've looked into them. But unfortunately, if you don't take those scholarships when you're fresh out of high school, they really don't count. And it's really hard not only with school, but with work. I had to, like, you know, work at like small places where sometimes they don't give you like what they owe you because \"oh, well, it's slow. So can I pay you next week?\" All because you know, you don't have a Social Security.\nSERRANO: What small jobs do refer to?\nORTEGA: Restaurants, you know, where they don't, they don't check for Social Securities. Restaurants, offices, you know, where it's just—local businesses. I guess that's what I'm referring to.\nSERRANO: Like are you saying that they sometimes, like, take advantage of you because you're undocumented?\nORTEGA: Yeah, you know, they know you're working with, you know, a fake Social. So why should they give you benefits? Why should, you know, or they pay you under the table? And if they don't have enough, it's like, \"Well.\" You know, I was working for this restaurant one time and they had—$100 might not seem, you know, like a lot, but it was a lot to me, especially when I was like 19, 20 years old and when I couldn't get a decent job. It was a lot and my boss never paid me. I like I kept calling him. Like, \"Hey, you owe me $100\" and he was like, \"Oh, yeah. Yeah next week. Next week.\" I never heard from him again. You know? Um, it's just those things and not only the pay. It also affects with, like, your emotional, your emotional being. Because I remember, you know, when I was working with this company, this big company, they weren't checking for, like, social, you know. And it was also a restaurant. But I know, like, my boss kept asking me, \"Yo, where's your state ID? I need your state ID to...for your documents.\" And I was like, \"Oh my God, where am I gonna get a state ID?\" Like, you know, and that time, like, my boyfriend was, you know, I had to, like, cry to him. I was inconsolable. Like I was like, \"What if I get fired? I need this money. I need to pay for school. I need to pay my bills. Like, what am I going to do?\" Like, there was a point where I just felt like I was nothing. But it feels like you're nothing here, but you're nothing in your own country. You're nothing in México either because, you know, you never grew up over there. So, who are you going to go to when you have your parents here, you know? There came a time where I just wanted to leave. Like, maybe in México everything will be better. I will be treated as a human being. But then I thought about it and I was like, \"But I have my family here, my parents. What am I gonna do without my parents? Who's gonna, like, who am I gonna go for consolation? What if it doesn't work and I can't come back?\" You know, and then we got the DACA. And yeah, it's a great help, but I just don't understand why Congress doesn't pass the DREAM Act. I really don't. You know, I feel like f they heard more stories like mine and like other people's, like, they would see how great it would be. You know, people want to study. People want... [she tears up] Sorry. People want to be good for this country. We don't want to be outlaws. You know, we don't...We're not here to take anybody's jobs. I think we're just... It's hard for us, because we were here since we were little. We don't know anything but this. And this is our home, you know?\nSERRANO: Yeah, so that's like one of the biggest struggles for an undocumented, like, person here and it's really sad.\nORTEGA: Uh-huh. Yeah, because you always hear it and you think, \"There'll be a chance,\" you know? An immigration reform.\nSERRANO: And you just feel lost here. Like what can you do?\nORTEGA: Yeah, because at the end of the day, it's always the bad guy that wins. It's always, you know, like, \"Oh, we're the terrorists.\" Like, \"Oh, well, yeah, you can work here, but you're only going to get, like, a work permit.\" You don't, you don't have—what? What can I say? Like enough benefits. You can never become a citizen. You know, like for me, my DACA expires, you know next year and I still have a chance to renew it for two more years. But then I turn 30, and what's going to happen after 30?\nSERRANO: There's just always going to be problems, right?\nSERRANO: There needs to be change. There needs to be more laws and it's good that, like, you're telling us your story because, like, that's good proof for later, like, studies and, you know, projects. And hopefully there will be change soon.\nORTEGA. Yes, I hope so. I know there's been many interviews and I know, you know, but a small voice can change and I hope my story, you know, can help. Can help a bit, or at least, you know, when I become someone's ancestor. They can see what the struggle was like.\nSERRANO: What do you think about the students that were...or just like people that were born here and don't take advantage of all these benefits and school and work and the things that you that you're facing that they don't have to face? What do you think about that?\nORTEGA: You know, there was a time when I was I was very upset about that. I had I used to have a boyfriend and, you know, he was he was born here. He had every advantage. He didn't want to. He didn't want it. And, you know, we...I think that was part of why our relationship didn't work because I wanted everything he had and he just didn't care for it. Um, you know, I always try to tell my brothers—I have two younger brothers—you know, I try to tell them to take advantage of what they can. You know, never look at it as like...never take something for granted because you never know what you have until you don't have it.\nSERRANO: Yeah. You don't have it.\nORTEGA: The smallest things. So, I always told him, like, he didn't like school, but I told him, \"You know what? You're getting all your school paid for. All you have to do is, you know, study.\" He was like, \"I hate it,\" but, you know, he got through it and he graduated and I'm proud of him. I just think, you know, you just—sometimes kids are lost because they don't have someone to look to or, you know, parents don't know how to, like, help them.\nSERRANO: Or talk to them, too.\nSERRANO: like how they grew up, too.\nORTEGA: Uh-huh. They don't know anything else and their parents, you can't blame the parents, either, because they don't know.\nSERRANO: Yeah. That's also, like, education, too. Like in schools. Like some teachers don't talk to them. The counselors don't, like, force them or, like, just encourage them to go to school.\nORTEGA: Yeah, I just think they don't know what to do with them because they don't have a way. You know, a path. So yeah, I think that's that's the biggest struggle.\nORTEGA: Especially for Latinos. We're very, you know—education is, you know, we...I think our parents—and that's why we're like this—we're always, like., working, working, working and, you know, \"Focus on work.\" And I think we want to be, you know, the best employees or, like, hard workers and we forget about certain things.\nSERRANO: Yeah. It's a cultural thing. Like, just the—instead of going—like, telling them to go to school, they're like, \"it's okay, mijo, just work.\"\nORTEGA: Yeah. \"Go to work, trabaja. We need money.\"\nSERRANO: Yeah. \"We need money.\" Yeah.\nORTEGA: Especially for men. Like, \"You have to be a man. How are you gonna, like, support your family when you get older?\" And they tend to forget, you know, an important.key to work is school.\nSERRANO: How was your, like, high school experience to like—like when, senior year, like, were you thinking about college or...?\nORTEGA: Ah, that's a good question because—oh, you know, I never realized I was undocumented until I was like a junior in high school.\nORTEGA: I mean, of course, you know, you didn't have, like, many benefits. But you also started seeing that because—what was that thing, Gallery 37? Back in the day? I don't think it exists now for public schools. But, back in the day, it was Gallery 37 and people, you know, it was like a little job after school. It wasn't really a job, but it was like a workshop and, you know, they would help you focus on things et cetera. But you needed a Social for that. And I could never join Gallery 37 because I never had a social security. Same with driver's ed. I had to take driver's ed to graduate, but I can never take range. You know, I I could never get my driver permit because I didn't have a Social and I wasn't allowed to. So, I passed my class with an A, but I I never went to range. I never did more than that because, \"Hey, you don't have the Social Security. [chatter off screen] You can edit it.\nSERRANO: Like, losing hope, right?\nORTEGA: Losing hope. You know, my parents—I have great parents. They're always supporting me. I remember the first time I went to apply to Harold Washington. I also felt discriminated because I only had my matrícula and the lady was like, \"Oh, do you have your state ID or your ID?\" And I was like, \"Oh, here it is.\" And she's like, \"Oh, okay.\" And I was like, she's like, \"Oh you got financial aid?\" And I'm like, \"No. I just want to, like, take classes.\" And I remember like, you know, they signed me up. And when I had to pay, it was like a thousand, five hundred. And I was like—I called my dad. I'm like, \"Pa, van a ser mil dolares.\" And I know. I know until this day, that credit card my dad is paying off every month, it's because of me. Like, some of that school money is for me. Because he would charge everything to that credit card. But, it also makes me, like, so happy because it makes me realize how great of parents I had. You know, they wanted me to keep going to school, so they would pay.\nSERRANO: So that you knew support that other parents don't have for their children.\nSERRANO: Yeah, that's good. Um, what else, like, have your parents done, like, to help you and support you? Like, other things?\nORTEGA: Other things? Well, other things? Not economically?\nORTEGA: Well, everything...I think, with my generation, everything's economical now. Ever since 9/11, it's hard to, like, move out by yourself and not, you know, not need your parents. I think they've supported me unconditionally. Like, by giving me a home up till now.\nORTEGA: Yeah, because when I was getting on my feet, you know, back on my feet with Macy's, that was like my first...I worked with Macy's. That was my first documented, you know, job where they checked for me. I was there all of, you know, a year and I was so happy. Like, because—okay, I think what people don't realize is, you know, \"Oh, well, you get a work permit.\" But they don't realize how long it takes to actually get a new job. Like, to get a new job, it takes months, you know? And what are you doing with that Social? Like, nothing, because you're still applying for jobs. By the time you get to the interview process, you know, everything—that becomes like three months that you haven't worked your Social. So, anyway, yeah, I was working. I was happy. I, you know, I had a lot of friends. Everything was great. And then, bam! I got let go of because of my documents and it was—I felt like it was a knockout, you know. Like, how am I going to move out when I can't be, you know, stable with these jobs? You know, I was unemployed for about a month after that happened. Two weeks after, I got my DACA renewed and I went back to Macy's and I'm like, \"Well, can I get my job back? You know, I have my documents now.\" And they're like, \"Well, you have to reapply all over again.\" And I'm like, \"Okay, nevermind.\" So that never happened. But yeah, and now I'm, I feel like after what, six months? I'm barely getting back on my feet, economically-wise. So, I think my parents have helped me with a great deal, economically-wise, just by giving me a home. And, as far as emotionally, like I said before, they've always been there for me. Always supporting me, you know, whatever I want to do. Yes, we don't agree with everything. You know, I think it's a cultural thing. You know, they grew up in Mexico with their beliefs. I grew up here with different beliefs. Times change, you know. We don't agree with everything, but, you know, we're—we go hand-in-hand and I know that no matter what, even though we disagree, they're always going to be there for me.\nSERRANO: Um, what do you think of, like, marriage or children? Do you think of those things at all?\nORTEGA: Well, you know, before, when I was a bit younger and I was single—even last year, I think—I always thought I was going to be single. It's harder, especially, you know, with, like, a girl. You know, that's where we bring discrimination again.\nORTEGA: I don't know if it's discrimination. I just think some men are not as strong-minded as others and it's hard in the dating world to, like, find a man that wants, that is not afraid to be...I consider myself a strong woman. I don't know, you know, what other men think, but I think they get a bit freaked out. Like, you know, I have a walking disability. I don't walk that great and they get a bit freaked out by you, especially in this century, where everything is like, you know, online dating. You know, that's where you meet everyone and it's like, \"Well, how am I going to tell them that?\"\nSERRANO: Yeah, it's a struggle.\nORTEGA: It's a struggle. Even like, I'm pretty sure, even if I didn't have like walking disability, just dating as hard, you know. But I don't know. I, you know, I've been dating my boyfriend for eight months now and, you know, I do think about marriage now. I'm getting close to 30. Maybe not soon, but I want to. I think, in that sense, I'm very I'm very old-school, you know. You know how people are having kids before marriage and then getting married. Well, to me marriage is still important, and I still want to get married. Before, I want to live with, you know, I want to live with him and then decide to have a child, you know?\nORTEGA: I always think of that. He tells me, you know, \"We can have a baby. Like, I'm not gonna leave you. You know, I'll be there for you. Like, you know, I love you.” But to me, I don't know it's to me it's a fairytale. I want to have my wedding even though if it's not big, I don't care. I don't want a glamorous wedding. You know, I want something small. But I just want to wear my dress and I want to tell my kids like hey, here's...this is your dad, this is me on our wedding day. I want to show him or show her, you know the wedding pictures and I want to have my little family, you know, I...you know, I don't have anything against for people who have kids before, you know, it's...everyone's entitled to their own beliefs and hopes and you know, how life works out. Nothing against that at all. Like, you know props to you for having a child. But to me that's always been my dream, you know: my wedding dress, my makeup done pretty, and, I don't know, just, just a memory. I think I've always looked up to that no matter how like, open-minded I am, I think that's one of my dreams.\nSERRANO: So, like those one of your dreams, or, um, ambitions. Do you have any like long-term or short-term goals that you have in mind right now?\nORTEGA: Well, my short-term goal. I'm very afraid of like driving. I don't know. I've had, you know, one of my best friends died in a car accident. My cousin died in a car accident. So I think that always freaks me out, driving. But those are my short-term goals now that I can get a driver's license.\nORTEGA: And that I can drive. One of my short term goals is that. My long-term goals is just...I don't know. I want to have a job that makes me happy and not be so afraid of like losing it because of my document status. Unfortunately, that is something I have to look into you know, but yeah, I just want a stable job. I want to be able to own, you know, a home.\nORTEGA: A home, and you know, be independent for myself and, you know, bring...I don't know, because I do think old school, but I also, you know, want to be an independent woman. Just in case, you know, something ever happens to my husband or you never know life circumstances. What if it doesn't work out? You never just want to depend on, you know, on your spouse for things. I also want to be independent for him and I want to make somebody proud, you know, and I want to be in I guess yeah move out. Those are my long-term goals. Have a stable job, you know. After that, once I'm stabilized maybe, you know start thinking about a family but who knows?\nSERRANO: Do you think like when you ever have children will you like continue the same like customs as your parents or like the same, you know, like ideas like about school? Work? Or the Mexican culture?\nSERRANO: That they agree with?\nSERRANO: With a lot of Mexican parents that are not as open-minded.\nORTEGA: Yeah. I mean, it's not like I want to tell my parents, \"Hey,\" you know, but I also don't want them to see it like a bad thing, you know, and... And I think I'll be more of an open-minded parent. I'm not there yet. So, I don't know how I'm going to be. Maybe I'll end up being the same because my parents always told me, \"Until you're a parent, you won't understand,\" you know, and I feel it's true. Like yeah, \"Ya va a saber cuando tengas hijos. Tú vas a sentir lo mismo.\" But I do want to be a bit more open-minded with that. You know, I, of course, I want to keep, like, la cocina. I think that like the taste in our food is the best. I want them to like know how to cook. I'm little by little I think since I have a more serious relationship now, I'm starting to like cook more and do things, you know, because before I was single and I was like, \"I don't care. I'm never gonna get married. I'm just gonna work for myself. And be independent.\"\nORTEGA: But I see my relationship developing and I'm like, \"Oooh, maybe, maybe I should like learn a bit more, you know, I'm almost 30. I need to like learn my customs with food. But yeah, definitely I want my kids to have what I didn't have you know. Um, even if I just have one child, I really hope she or he will go to school. I want them to have the dorm life. I always wanted to go away for college. That was one of my biggest dreams. Like to go away for college, you know to come back and just be like like a college student.\nSERRANO: Like in the movies, right? Or in the TV shows?\nORTEGA: Yeah. Because with white culture they always show that in the movies. Even in scary movies and, like, ¿cómo se dice? Romantic comedies. It's like, \"Oh, yeah, well, I'm going to college.\" And, \"Oh, everything is so perfect.\" But in reality, especially Latino, you know, middle class, you don't get any of that. So, you know, I kind of I want to work hard for my kids. I want to I want them to have what I didn't have. I don't want to give I don't want to hand them everything either. Like I said before, I want them to work hard for what they want, too.\nSERRANO: What are some of the things that you wish your parents had like taught you or like, your ideas of a mom? What would you have changed for it, from your parents?\nORTEGA: You know, it's har— from my mom, I guess just being a little more open with conversation. I mean, we have a relationship. We talk. But we clash in a lot of things. You know, like. \"Oh, don't get home late. Don't sleep over with you know, your boyfriend.\" And it's like, \"Mom. I'm almost, you know, 30 years old. I'm 28. I know that like... My boyfriend and I took a trip back in March, and my mom was like, \"Well, I hope this doesn't happen often where you guys, you know, take trips.\" And it's like, \"But why not? We're in like a good relationship. He respects me. I respect him\", you know. \"We're trying to, like, be grown-ups here.\" As far as being open like with you know, with cultural things like those, you know, they still want you to live at home till you get married. You know, I've talked to my mom about moving out several times and she's always like, \"Well, why don't you just give me you know, what you would pay to me, like, and you can live here.\" And it's like, \"Yes, mom, but you always say that I'm living under your roof, so I have to follow your rules.\" And she's like, \"Well, my rules aren't that hard. I just ask you to come home early and not bring your boyfriend to your room.\" And it's like, \"But I don't want to follow that. I want to go out with my friends, you know, get some drinks. If we want to go out of the state border, why not?\" I don't, I don't want to feel that pressure. And most of our fights are because of that. Because I haven't come home and every time I do something it's like I have to tell her, \"Hey, I'm okay. Like I'll see you home later,\" you know. And, and that's really hard for me. It's hard. It, you know, because...Especially when your boyfriend's parents are a little bit more open-minded and you guys live far away from each other. It's almost like a long-distance, distance relationship. It's hard, you know, you started having a bit of relationship problems because of it. And you start getting stressed out. It's a cultural shock for sure, you know, because your parents want you...they bring you here to have a better life, but they want you to grow up as they grew up in Mexico. But they don't see how like culture or how, like, people, society works here, you know.\nSERRANO: Do you think your mom also thinks, like, sees you as a little kid and doesn't want you to grow up?\nSERRANO: ...live under their rules.\nORTEGA: Live under their rules. And I think it frightens them to, you know, when you tell them you want to move out because they feel like they have no control over you. And I think what makes them feel sure about things that they have a better control over you. And that makes them feel like you're safe. And once you move out, it's like, \"Well, how am I going to protect my little girl, you know?\nSERRANO: Yeah, but they can't do anything anymore once you to leave their house.\nSERRANO: Yeah, they can still be part of your life, but they can't make your decisions anymore. Most of your decisions.\nORTEGA: Exactly, you know. So yeah, it's something, it's something hard and I think, you know, I kind of, you know, gave my mom the idea that me and my boyfriend might move out soon together and she's like, \"Oh, well, what about marriage?\" And it's like, \"Yeah, but that'll come with time, you know.\"\nSERRANO: Do they tell you a lot about that? Like marriage? Like they force you? Like, \"Come on, get married already?\"\nORTEGA: Not so much about marriage, but they do tell me a lot about grandchildren.\nORTEGA: Yeah, even, like, my aunts or, my aunts or my, yeah, my aunts or my uncles. They're like, \"O, pues, ya. Como que ya.\"\nSERRANO: \"Es el tiempo,\" ¿verdad?\nORTEGA: \"Ya te toca a ti.\" And it's like, \"No.\" But yeah, I always hear it. They're like, \"No, no, take your time.\" But you know that part of the joke was kind of true.\nORTEGA: And they're always telling me like, \"Oh, yeah, it's your turn. We need a baby around the house.\" And it's like, \"Ha ha. Well, you guys have to wait till I'm married,\" you know? But see, this is how, like, it contradicts everything because they tell you they want you to get married, but then they see you growing old and it's like, \"Well, where's my grandbaby?\"\nORTEGA: So, I feel like you can never have anyone happy and that's why you have to make your own decisions, even if your parents don't agree with them, because you're the only one that is going to be happy. You're never going to make anyone happy if you go by your, by your parents' rules. I'm pretty sure like if I followed all of my parents’ rules, you know, like, they wouldn't be happy regardless. So, I mean, it's just the cultural thing. I'm not saying my parents are the worst parents. No. I appreciate them. I just think we don't think the same.\nSERRANO: You just had to, like, find a way to make them understand.\nORTEGA: Sometimes you have to break the rules to make yourself happy.\nSERRANO: Yeah. Also, for them to see that it's not that big of a deal as they think it is.\nORTEGA: Exactly. Because now they're used to me like this. Then, you know, I'm always going to be more of a punk rocker than a classy lady. Well, hey, I'm still classy, but I'm I'm a little darker than most.\nSERRANO: So, what do you think is the thing that motivates you right now the most like to keep on with life and be positive?\nORTEGA: Thank you. I'm so happy for them. Like, so happy for them. Even if it's not me, I'm just happy that they're going to be doing things, you know? They're going to be doing things that they love. They're gonna go see family that we haven't seen in years. They're going to get to travel with my little brothers, you know, as a family. Even if I'm here, like I said, I'm an adult. You know, I wish I could travel with them, but some things are unfortunate, but I think their happiness is my happiness. So, I'm just so happy for them.\nORTEGA: Another motivation. I just, you know, I landed a great job with a great company and I feel unstoppable because, I don't know, as I said before, like, you have to prove yourself with people and I feel like I didn't have to try that hard with them. You know, I feel like I was...they were what I was looking for what they were looking for and what I was looking for, too, and I'm very happy. I feel like there's no stopping. You know I have, you know, supportive family everywhere.

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "We have long recommended WPML as a great way to translate WordPress pages. Now, the WPML team have released a substantial update, allowing users to translate Elementor pages and posts in a much easier way than ever before.\nWPML is one of the most popular translation plugins and has been around since 2009. In fact, it’s one of the most popular commercial plugins as well, with over 400,000 WordPress sites using it to translate their content.\nIn its latest feature release, WPML has released a page builder addon, allowing users to translate the entire page they’ve made in Elementor, including all of its elements, from a single and convenient editor. You can read more about this, with step by step instructions, in WPML’s release post.\nIt has now become extremely easy to translate pages with WPML, because you can freely add text to any text widget, and then translate it in the WPML editor. After you finish crafting the entire page, all the widget texts will automatically appear in WPML’s Translation Editor.\nStep 1: Create your page. You can use any of the following widgets: Heading, Text Editor, Video, Button, Icon, Price List, Price Table, Flip Box, Slides, Image Box, Icon Box, Icon List, Counter, Progress Bar, Testimonial, Tabs, Accordion, Toggle, Alert, HTML & Form.\nStep 2: Go to the page dashboard and click on the plus icon next to Translate in the WPML box.\nStep 3: In the translation editor, add your translation to each of the widgets. be sure to check the box to indicate the translation is complete.\nStep 4: Once the translation for all the widgets is complete, the translation bar will show 100% complete. Now you can click on ‘Save and close’.\nYou should now be sent back to the dashboard, with the page, including all widgets, translated with WPML.\nYou can also outsource the translation of the Elementor page using WPML’s translation management. After you add the page to the Translation Basket, you’ll be able to choose the translator that the page will be sent to.\nThat translator will have access to the same translation editor described earlier. Once the translator finishes the job, the page will be available on the site.\nAfter you update a page you have already translated, an update icon will appear in the WPML box in the dashboard of the page, notifying you the translation needs updating. Inside the translation editor, you will see the new heading text and will be able to add the proper translation to it.\nAlmost every Elementor widget contains links. Buttons, Icon box, Images, Tabs and so on… Now, when you add links to any of Elementor’s widgets, WPML automatically updates the links in the translated versions to make them point to translated content.\nWPML stated that they are working on adding the option to translate texts that come from image widgets, as well as other new features coming up.\nAccording to Google Analytics from Elementor.com, approximately 56% of our audience are English speakers. Moreover, English speaking users should also consider creating multilingual sites, in order to reach a broader global audience.\nThese users can greatly benefit from WPML’s latest update. We have gotten a lot of questions about creating multilingual websites with Elementor, so I am sure this updates will be appreciated. I’d like to thank the entire WPML team for significantly upgrading the process of translating Elementor content.\nI think this update says something about the way in which page builders have recently become a crucial element in every WordPress website. We are happy to continue to lead the cause of making web design fun and intuitive in WordPress.\nIf you are looking for free translation plugins that work with Elementor, I suggest you try TranslatePress and Polylang.\nOne final related note. If you speak a foreign language, this is a great chance to contribute to the Elementor project and add an online translation to our page builder.\nREALLY happy with this.

But if you’re worried about what to wear when you’re heading to the casinos, there’s no need to panic. While the movies might have us believe that everyone taking a spin on the lightning roulette wheel is dressed in black tie, the reality is that casinos generally have a more relaxed, smart casual approach to clothing. But what does smart casual consist of and what should you wear to be as comfortable as possible without standing out for all the wrong reasons? Here are some tips on how to dress right for the occasion and blend in when you’re at a casino.\nThink about how you’d dress to go to a nice bar, and you’ll be on the right lines for how to dress at a casino. Scruffy lounge clothes or what you’d wear to the gym is off limits, but anything that wouldn’t look out of place in a sophisticated environment should be just fine. If your trainers are dirty or tattered, you should choose something else for footwear too, but if you’re more comfortable in trainers than formal shoes then as long as they’re smart, you’ll be welcome to wear them.\nSo, does the attire change for poker rooms? Well, you can wear baseball caps and hoodies like they do on TV if you want, but once you’re on the casino floor, you’ll be expected to dress a little smarter, so bear this in mind. If you think you’ll want to try out different games throughout the night, your best option is to stick to smart casual, so you have the flexibility on where you go in the casino, rather than being limited to just the poker room. Whether you want to go all out and dress smart or you want to be more comfortable throughout the evening, the choice is yours – the best piece of advice to remember is to go for quality items in your wardrobe that aren’t scruffy, dirty or super casual.\nHours of sitting or walking around to different games will take the shine off of uncomfortable heels, suit jackets or anything too snug, so think about how you’re going to feel in your outfit by the end of the evening after a few cocktails. If there’s any chance you won’t be feeling like your most confident or elegant self, give it a miss. For guys, it might look like a smart pair of jeans and a comfortable shirt; ladies might prefer a comfy pair of trousers or a dress with flat shoes. Each casino is different though so before you go, check out their dress code to give you an idea of the right type of outfit for your night. Whatever you wear, keep it classy so you can be sure that you’ll be looking your best whether you win big or not."}

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "Some 200 species of these pests cause problems. Like aphids (their close relatives), they’re sap feeders, sucking plant juices from leaf undersides. The adults, which look like tiny white moths, fly up in a cloud when disturbed. Some of the nymphal stages resemble scale insects. Whiteflies are found the year around in warm climates; in colder regions, you’ll see them only during summer. Warm, still air is the perfect environment for whiteflies, making greenhouses a favored haunt—one species is even called the greenhouse whitefly.\nDamage: Heavily infested plants lose vigor and may turn yellow, but the biggest problem is usually honeydew, which attracts ants and fosters sooty mold. Some adult whiteflies transmit viruses.\nLife cycle: Adults lay minuscule eggs on leaf undersides. Yellowish nymphs hatch out and begin to feed; they lose their antennae and legs in the first molt, after which they’re immobile throughout the remaining nymphal stages. All adults are winged, but only the females develop legs. There are many overlapping generations each year.\nNotes: Absolute control isn’t needed since plants can withstand moderate infestations. Use nitrogen fertilizers sparingly—the insects reproduce faster under high-nitrogen conditions. Pick off heavily infested leaves and destroy them. Control ants to keep them from protecting white-flies from natural enemies."}

The LTM9013’s quadrature sampling architecture enables acquisition of up to 300MHz of signal bandwidth with IMD3 performance of 66dB across the entire band. The receiver is targeted for wideband, low IF receivers and wireless base stations implementing power amplifier (PA) linearization with digital predistortion (DPD). The LTM9013 leverages years of applications design expertise to offer high integration, ease of use, with repeatable and guaranteed system performance to increase production yields and time to market.\nDue to increasing data demands from mobile users, next-generation base stations are now architected to achieve much higher transmit bandwidths of up to 60MHz. To linearize a transmit bandwidth of 60MHz, the predistortion feedback loop for the linearization algorithm must acquire fifth order intermodulation products out to 300MHz. Digitizing the fifth order intermodulation distortion requires a very wide bandwidth, low noise receiver with an exceptionally flat passband. The LTM9013 includes a 300MHz lowpass filter that exhibits less than 1.3dB passband ripple across the entire band. Since DPD is a feedback loop, the receiver (also called a transmit observation path receiver) benefits from low latency; a faster loop leads to better efficiency in the PA and therefore even lower power consumption. The ADC in the LTM9013 has just 5 clock cycles of latency.\nThe LTM9013 is packaged in a space-saving 15 mm × 15 mm ball grid array (BGA) package, utilizing a multilayer substrate that shields sensitive analog lines from the digital traces to minimize digital feedback. Supply and reference bypass capacitance is placed inside the µModule package, tightly coupled to the die, providing space, cost and performance advantages over traditional packaging.\nThe LTM9013 is priced starting at $65.00 each in 1,000 piece quantities. Demo boards, samples and more information are available at www.linear.com/product/LTM9013."}

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "Another project I was involved in was the translation of the New Testament into Telugu. The older Catholic translation was totally out of date and in direct conflict with the Protestant version – which caused endless confusion.\nFor example, the French missionaries who had evangelised Andhra Pradesh in the 18th century, had rendered Greek biblical names into corresponding Telugu designations. ‘Peter’ became ‘Râyappa’ [rock-man], ‘Paul’ became ‘Chinnappa’ [small-statured man], ‘Jesus’ was ‘Djêsuvu’. The Protestant bible translated these names as ‘Pêturu’, ‘Pauludu’, ‘Yêsu’. The Catholic rendering of more than 100 names in the Gospel of Mark for instance, was different from the Protestant one in every single case. Hindus scoffed at Christians being so divided that they could not even agree on a common Telugu name for Jesus!\nArchbishop Arulappa, Bishop Mummadi and I.\nSo we began a process of preparing a new ecumenical version of the bible in Telugu. A cross-denominational committee was set up. On the Catholic side it included Bishop Ignatius Mummadi, Bishop of Guntur who had previously been editor of the Catholic weekly Bharatamithram; Dr Gali Bali, my scripture colleague in St. John’s College; Fr P. Jojayya SJ who held a master’s degree in Telugu literature and me.\nWe met on various occasions in different towns of Andhra Pradesh. Our Protestant colleagues found in their ranks a bible lecturer from the Church of South India, a Baptist pastor and ministers from a variety of denominations. They were well-intentioned men, but, as experience showed, utterly ill-equipped for the job.\nAt the same time we had started negotiations with the Protestant Bible Society about an eventual joint publication of the Telugu Bible. Bishop Ignatius Mummadi and I travelled to Bangalore and held prolonged meetings with Rev Arangaden, Secretary of the Indian Bible Society, and other officials. These revealed a large revenue of resentment against Catholics in other Christian denominations. We realised that we had to find another way. It suddenly showed itself – through the good services of another Protestant ministry.\nThe American Bible Society came to the rescue. They organised training sessions for translators during the dry season in Ooty, a hill station in the Nilgiris mountain range of Tamilnadu. And these training sessions were run by real experts: Eugene Nida and Robert Bratcher, the well-known translator of the Today’s English Version of the New Testament.\nI took part in two of them. In the first one as a keen learner, two years afterwards as one of the lecturers – by invitation.\nThe American approach was revolutionary. It had been developed by Eugene Nida and was called translation by ‘dynamic equivalence’.[i] It carefully distinguishes the deep structure of meaning from the surface structure through which the meaning is expressed in a particular language. Paul’s blessing in Ephesians 1,3-10, for example, is a typical Greek string-phrase consisting of 129 words. A literal translation into English is unreadable. The dynamic equivalent found in ‘Today’s English Version’ renders the meaning accurately in seven sentences.\nserious deviations from the normal pattern of sentence construction.\nSmall wonder that the Bible had acquired a reputation of having been written in very poor Telugu. Half-intelligible westernized language was commonly referred to as Bible Telugu among educated Hindus. “I wanted to read the Bible, but looking at one page was enough for me”, characterized the honest reaction of many Hindu enquirers.\nThen there was the question of terms and concepts. When the Christian message is translated into a language culture, much depends on the adoption of accurate and felicitous terms. The problem is an old one. The Christian community in early Rome struggled with it; in some cases it adopted Latin terms and gave them a new meaning (sacramentum; ministerium); in many other cases it stressed the uniqueness of Christian concepts by introducing Greek terms (eucharistia; baptisma; presbyter).\nThere was general recognition of the fact that Christian terminology in Telugu badly needs to be revised. Investigation of the terminology used in the three most widely used texts of instruction: a Bible history for the primary school, the handbook for catechists, and a textbook for high school students showed that the situation was highly unsatisfactory. Many terms were triple or quadruple compound words of Sanskrit origin and therefore difficult for ordinary people to learn or remember. ‘Grace’ was rendered as dêvavaraprasâdamu, original justice as parishudhdhamunubhâgyamainasthiti. Many terms suggested a mistaken meaning. For instance, the word for ‘sacrament’, dêvadravyânumânamu, could be read, in ordinary Telugu, as meaning: ‘suspicion’ (anumânamu) of ‘God’s treasure’ (dêvadravyamu).\nAnother source of embarrassment was the apparent disregard of the normal semantic connotations of Telugu religious terms. For human ‘love’ of God, Christians used a term normally employed for love between husband and wife, or a mother and her children. Môkshamu means a state of bliss, but Christian texts spoke of it as a place – ‘heaven’ – where one was going to meet people and which one needed to enter by a gate.\nThe metaphors in scriptural texts proved far removed from those common in Telugu. Animals, for example, conveyed distinct characters in Telugu literature, notably in the stories of the Pancha Tantra. The wit and wisdom of daily life had added its own verdict on animals and the lessons we can draw from them. Comparison with the function of animal metaphors in the Gospels and ordinary Telugu thought, bore out a horrendous mismatch.\nMe, holding a typical sheep from the Andhra countryside.\nPart of it was due to context and culture. Many animals that occupy an important place in Telugu metaphorical thinking do not occur at all in the gospel message: the bull, the elephant, the cow, the monkey, the cat, the tiger, the crow, the buffalo and so on. More seriously, images of scriptural animals conveyed a distorted meaning. In Telugu thinking the sheep is not an animal to be pitied, loved and cared for, but the symbol of unthinking, stupid, herd behaviour. Unfortunately, the situation could not be remedied by substituting known animals for unknown ones in particular Bible texts. Footnotes to the text were essential.\nIt has been said that culture may be compared to a floating iceberg of which only the top can be seen and of which ninety per cent remains under water. One all-pervading element which normally remains invisible, but which determines the meaning of words and events, is the commonly accepted interpretation of experience. This interpretation is made up of: norms by which persons and things are judged, expectations and aims, and the values attributed to situations or events. Experiential interpretation is difficult to define, as it belongs to the implicit and subconscious realms of thinking. One can only understand this cultural interpretation of experience by making the culture in question one’s own, by internalizing that culture.\nWho are those who received the first invitation? Why is it not said that they are the king’s relatives and friends who are normally invited to marriages?\nHow could the king commit the impoliteness of sending a verbal invitation through his servants?\nWhy are the guests invited to the meal and not to the marriage ceremony? The Telugu invitation formula says, ‘Please come to impose hands on the bride and bridegroom and share with us sandalwood, flowers and betelnut’.\nWhy are the bride and bridegroom not mentioned at all in the parable?\nWhy this crude mention of the bulls and cows that have been slaughtered? The cow is a sacred animal and the bull such a dear friend that it is buried after death and never eaten.\nWhy should the readiness of the meal be adduced as a reason for hurry? Instead, in India it would be understandable if the king were to be worried about the passing of the astrologically correct time for the marriage rite.\nHow can the king take revenge in such a barbaric and naive way, namely by killing those who refused to accept his invitation?\nHow can we imagine guests ‘lying at table’? Why don’t they sit in rows on the floor as is the Indian custom?\nHow could the king be so ungracious as to become angry with one of the guests? And, for that matter, what is a ‘wedding garment’?\nWhy does the king not content himself with a simple removal of the impolite guest from the festive hall? Why this peculiar treatment of ‘binding his hands and feet’ and ‘throwing him into outer darkness’?\nFrom examples such as this one, which could be multiplied indefinitely, it was clear that much more than word for word translation was required. To do full justice to the Bible message, it needed a dynamically equivalent re-telling within the local cultural context and the adoption of India’s own literary forms.\nIt may seem that I have deviated from the original thrust of this chapter: my involvement in the translation of sacred scripture into Telugu. However, my diversion served a purpose. It shows that I myself and Catholic members of our translation committee began to realise that only a radically new approach would do justice to the job.\nWhen we met again, now as a Catholic translation committee, we took some important decisions. We resolved to produce our own translation independently from the Protestant Bible Society, while maintaining friendly relationships. Also, for ecumenical reasons, we agreed to adopt the Telugu translation of biblical names favoured in Protestant circles.\nMoreover, we decided to adopt the principle of ‘dynamic equivalence’ advocated by Eugene Nida. Cultural anomalies in the text would need to be explained in footnotes, but the text itself should be phrased in first-rate Telugu. It should not only be easily understandable to the ordinary Telugu reader but at the same time be a delight to those well versed in literature. Up to then all vernacular translations had been unnatural, stiff, too literal and obviously of foreign origin. We were determined to break with that tradition.\nTo achieve this purpose, we followed the new translation procedure of the American Bible Society.[v] A well-known literary writer was chosen as the first draft writer: Mr. Kondaveeti Kavi, who had earned two special Telugu literary titles: kavirâzu (king of poets) and kalaprapurna (completion in art). Being a spontaneous thinker in the Telugu language, a Hindu and college lecturer, Kondaveeti would not make the mistake of falling back into second-grade Telugu, or worse still, into Bible-Telugu. Therefore, not only the formulation of the first draft, but also, after exegetical corrections pointed out by the translation committee, the final amendment of the text was left to him.\nOn the 22nd of March, 1973 the Bishops’ Conference of Andhra Pradesh released a new translation of the Four Gospels in Telugu under the title Rakshana Vêdam, the ‘holy treatise on salvation’.[vi] The text was soon acclaimed by Telugu scholars as a genuine Telugu piece of writing. This release was an important event. It was important not only because Telugu is the second biggest language of India. Neither merely because of the fact that it was a subsidized edition costing people no more than one Rupee per copy. It was an important event because the translation marked the beginning of a new approach in theology and evangelization, and I am proud of having been part of that.\n[i] E. Nida and Ch. R.

I take the bus almost every day and I see some interesting people.\nLast Thursday, I was taking the bus out into the countryside to one of my four schools. I was sitting in the back when a mentally handicapped man and an older man got on and sat down next to me, the handicapped one closer to me. He was interested in my book and pointed at it and gave me a thumbs up. Then he motioned to the older man and said, “He’s my dad.” This caused the older man to start laughing, so I didn’t know if he really was his father or not. I just said, “Oh, really?” “Oh, I see” and such things, since he kept saying it.\nA lot of the people on the bus were older and seemed to know each other, so I felt like I was in kind of a community meeting. Then the handicapped man said, “He’s fifty” pointing to his “dad”, who started laughing even harder and said, “Yeah, I wish I were fifty again.” I really liked the older man; just a jolly sort of fellow.\nA middle-aged woman came back, and saw there weren’t any seats left, so I gave her mine. Her husband was still standing up, with his backpack on. “Hey groom!” she yelled (Korean woman often call their husbands “groom”, although I’ve never heard a man call his wife “bride”). “Hey groom! It’s going to be a long ride. Take off your heavy backpack.” He took it off and put it on the floor with a grin. “That’s my groom for you,” she said. I saw other older women smiling and nodding as well. They understood.\nThe two men who were sitting next to me got off a few stops before me and the handicapped one gave me an awkward high-five. I smiled and said good bye. I went back and sat where they had been sitting and the woman I had given up my seat to apologized. I’m not sure why but possibly because she thought the handicapped man was bothering me. “Not a problem,” I said. “It’s okay.” And I meant it. I may never totally fit in here in Korea, but I do enjoy being a part of things anyway.\nBy the way, a few days ago, I posted something called The Mystery on the Bus, recounting another experience I had on a bus coming home from school. I asked people what they thought was going on. The first virtual high-five is for Carmelita, for the wackiest idea (I almost wish it were true), and the second is for EadesyBeadsy, for what I think is the most likely answer. Good job!\nThis is a true story, just to put that out there right away. I was on the bus a few days ago, coming home from school. In Korea, there are no school buses, so most high school students use the city buses. My bus was crowded with students and although I had a seat, it was just a solid wall of people in front of me.\nI was looking out the window when another bus passed us. That bus driver looked at our bus and his mouth formed a perfect “O” of surprise. I was just wondering what he could have been looking at when a second bus passed. That bus driver looked over with a wide grin on his face and actually took his hands off the wheel while driving to applaud. I have no idea what they were reacting to, but it was intriguing.\nSo, help me out: what do you think they were looking at? The best answer in comments wins a virtual high-five.\nI think I’m a pretty positive guy. I try to look on the bright side of things. I only say that because I don’t anything to think of this as a gripe. It is merely a chance to share my unique work situation.\nHere in Korea, the school year starts at the beginning of March, so I have just finished the first couple weeks of school. And I am very glad about that. I know a lot of people don’t like going back to school (students especially), but there are several unique factors for a foreign English teacher in my position that makes the first week of school a lot less fun.\nI don’t have a car. If I did, this would not be an issue. I do have a motorbike and the bus system here is very good, but still, it takes a while to get everything straightened out.\nI live in a city of about 600,000, but I work in the countryside around the city, which means I can’t walk to my schools. In times past, some of the teachers would pick us foreigners up, but they usually don’t like doing that anymore, and honestly, I don’t like getting picked up. Even if I have to take a bus, I like to be independent. I can ride my motorbike to two of my schools (I work at four different schools) because they’re relatively close, unless of course it’s pouring rain or a blizzard or the bike’s broken. In other words I have to know how to get to all my schools by bus.\nUnfortunately, all of my schools are in different directions and I have to transfer buses to all of them, so I have to coordinate two bus schedules to make sure I get to the transfer stop before the second bus gets there. All this for four different schools which start at different times. I ended up being to late to one school and having to take a taxi to another one the first day in order not to be late.\nI’ve lived in Korea for nine years and have taught public school here for five years so I pretty much know what’s going on. I speak the language, can use chopsticks, know the bus system, and everything else you need to survive. But I’m not Korean, so everyone naturally (or not) assumes I got off the plane yesterday. I don’t necessarily blame them, since there is a high turnover rate for foreign English teachers and so a lot of us are fresh off the plane. Still, the first day or two at a new school is invariably the same.\nAnd so on. Again, I’m not trying to criticize the Korean teachers, but it does get tiring when you go through the same routine again and again and again.\nEven though I know a lot about Korea and public schools in general, every new school I go to has its own idiosyncrasies, for one reason or another. One of my schools is built like someone found the plans to the Labyrinth, thought that looked too straightforward and kicked it up a notch. Schools all start at different times, one has lunch after three periods instead of four. Some have English classes in an English room; others in the classrooms. In other words, I do some wandering around sometimes, asking people a lot of questions like where the bathrooms are and what the password to the class computer is.\nOne of my schools. It looks straightforward, but it’s best to hire a Sherpa if you have class in one of the far buildings.\nHow long does it take to introduce yourself? Not the whole 45-minutes of class, that’s for sure. Even if I show them the Introduction to my Hometown powerpoint that I have, it only takes five minutes. Now I have been teaching long enough that I come prepared to get the kids talking and fill up the period but it tends to be awkward and I do the same lesson over and over again. I’m not complaining, but I’m always happy when the first week is over so I can get into real teaching."}

Indian researchers evaluated the combination of all three – called lemon honey juice fasting – for their effects on the health of people in the short term.\nThe researchers received support from the Swami Vivekananda Yoga Anusandhana Samsthana University. They published their findings in the journal Pharmaceutical Biology.\nThe study group consisted of 50 healthy adults. Each participant consumed 300 milligrams of lemon honey juice four times a day as their only food. The fasting period lasted for four days.\nThe characteristics of the participants were evaluated before and after the fasting periods. The results were statistically analyzed to determine patterns between individuals and between men and women.\nParticipants who followed lemon honey juice fasting enjoyed considerable reduction in body mass index, fat mass, free fat mass, total serum triglycerides, and weight. Meanwhile, their fat percentage and total serum cholesterol showed smaller but obvious reductions.\nGroup analysis showed that the results for female participants did not diverge. The outcomes for individual males, however, varied widely. This suggested that gender could play a part in the effectiveness of the diet.\nThe juice fasting could contribute to lower body weight, body mass index, fat mass, free fat mat, and total serum triglycerides.\nBased on their findings, the researchers posited that lemon honey juice fasting could help prevent the onset of obesity and hypertriglyceridemia in healthy people.\nThe full study can be reviewed at this link.\nVisit Naturopathy.news to read up on more naturopathic uses for honey and lemon.\nKoffuor GA, Boye A, Kyei S, Ofori-Amoah J, Asiamah EA, Barku A, Acheampong J, Amegashie E, Awuku AK.

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "My favorite Disney theme park is Epcot. While some may question my sanity, one visit to Epcot during the annual Flower and Garden Festival will change your mind. Walt Disney World has done a wonderful job with the Flower and Garden Festival, especially the last few years, and it is now something people plan their trips around, just like the Epcot Food and Wine Festival in the Fall.\nWhile you can just show up at Epcot during the Flower and Garden Festival and enjoy the park, you really should know what is available to you so you can plan ahead.\nFor the first time ever, the Epcot Flower and Garden Festival will run for 90 days, from March 2 – May 30, 2016.\n30 million blooms blanket the park throughout the festival, which runs 90 colorful days and requires two complete crop rotations to keep floral displays fresh and seasonal.\nThe festival’s front-entrance Fresh Food, Fun & Flowers topiary scene, inspired by a 1943 Donald Duck comic book called The Victory Garden features three new Disney Character topiaries — the first-ever Huey, Dewey and Louie topiaries in a comical gardening scene. More than 30 varieties of flowers, plants, and other garden materials are used to create the scene.\nThe new Floral Sun topiary scene behind Spaceship Earth paints the landscape with golden colors, and 15 yellow “sunbursts” of red and yellow Joseph’s coat pop up in a Future World topiary bed.\nMusic Garden Melodies with Fab Five topiaries, a themed playground for children complete with innovative play systems featuring interactive musical gadgets, is one of the largest festival gardens created at nearly one-third acre. The garden includes a collection of plants with features that resemble musical instruments as part of the ambiance.\nAnna and Elsa in full floral splendor appear (new in 2015) move to a fresh topiary vignette straight from the hit Disney film, “Frozen.” In the Norway pavilion scene that’s wired to twinkle by night, Elsa works her magic to conjure a colorful spring garden. About 25 varieties of flowers are planted to evoke the scene. Florals including hot pink, red, and orange Gerberas, blue and yellow Violas, violet Petunias and purple Dianthus blanket the spring transformation. Anna and Elsa topiaries are each about 6-1/2 feet tall and are created with plants that include variegated Ficus, green Ficus and the succulent Sedum Coral Reef. But Elsa will look taller because she’s standing closer to guests than Anna by about 8 feet.\nAt least 25 different plants, grasses and mosses of various colors, including pink and red begonias, dusty miller, palm fiber, palm seeds, ficus and lichen, are used to create and define facial and other features of festival character topiaries. The topiary team uses about 200 one-pound boxes of hairpins to attach plants and flowers to the topiaries.\nNearly 1,000 native butterflies represent up to 10 species at the expansive Butterflies on the Go butterfly house. Among the garden’s two dozen nectar plants are passion flower, coral honeysuckle, lantana, butterfly bush, blue porterweed, scarlet milkweed and canna lily.\nForty 8-to-9-foot tall “flower towers” in an orange-and-green sunburst theme make colorful statements across the festival landscape.\nIf you love Flowers, there isn’t anywhere better to be in the Spring than in Epcot.\nYes, my garden is full of rocks too, but we are talking about a different kind of rock. Rock and Roll! Each year during the Flower and Garden Festival, Disney puts on weekend concerts from classic rock groups, included in the price of admission. Yes, free concerts! For 2016, check out this line-up!\nPerformances are at America Gardens Theatre in the World Showcase at 5:30, 6:45, and 8 p.m. every Friday, Saturday and Sunday during the Flower and Garden Festival. Admission is included in your Epcot admission, though show up early, the concerts fill up quickly.\nOne of my favorite things about the Epcot Food and Wine Festival are the food booths scattered throughout the World Showcase that feature food from countries around the world that are not represented in the World Showcase, and a few booths the enhance the food offerings of some of the represented countries. What a great way to spend an afternoon or evening, strolling around the World Showcase snacking on fantastic cuisine. Finally, someone at Disney got smart and they added the food kiosks to the Flower and Garden Festival a few years ago. While there are not as many as in the Fall, there are plenty to enjoy.\nThere will be two new kiosks available for 2016 guests: La Isla Fresca will feature flavors like Jamaican Braised Beef with Pigeon-Pea Rice and Jerk-Spiced Grouper or Chicken with Mango Salsa. At the new Cider House, a Field Greens salad with greens harvested from The Land pavilion, heirloom apples, Stilton cheese and dried blueberries will pair well with a blueberry hard cider from Plant City, Fla. Dozens of new food and beverage flavors will debut, as well, at the festival’s 11 other Outdoor Kitchens: Urban Farm Eats, Pineapple Promenade, Fleur de Lys, Florida Fresh, Taste of Marrakesh, Hanami, THE SMOKEHOUSE: Barbecue and Brews, Primavera Kitchen, Lotus House, Bauernmarkt and Jardin de Fiestas.\nMost food items at the outdoor kitchens can be purchased using a snack credit from your Disney Dining plan. Most places also offer some sort of drink option as well (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) which are usually not available with a snack credit.\nSomething new for 2016, Fun, Fresh Weekends. During some of the weekends, Disney will offer themed events that may be of interest to you, especially for locals who can plan a day at Epcot just for these special weekends.\nApril 29 – May 1—Florida Fresh Weekend features the state’s edible bounty from Apalachicola to Zellwood.\nIf you are going to be at Disney World during the Flower and Garden Festival, DO NOT miss Epcot. If you are planning a Disney World vacation either for 2016 or 2017, consider planing it during this festival, it does not disappoint."}
{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "Still a rarity on East Coast menus, Kusshis are all the rage out West, due to their small size and ultra-clean flavor. Grown by Keith Reid, a highly innovative grower in Deep Bay, Kusshis are grown in floating trays and tumbled very aggressively. This breaks off the thin growing edge and forces them to deepen and thicken their shells. The resulting oyster, called a Kusshi, Japanese for “precious,” is almost as deep as it is long—just over two inches. The unusual cornucopia shape and stunning smooth purple-black shell are due to the tumbling, which smoothes off any frills. The depth and pillowy softness inside make the Kusshi resemble a Kumamoto, but it’s a plain-old Pacific that’s been tumbled into bonsai form."}
{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "With the just announced iPhone XS, such photos will be of course of much better quality – colour saturation, depth of focus. I can hardly wait to order one.\nAn extremely hot day but thankfully the drive to the National park and bird sanctuary was in a late model 4 wheel Toyota – air conditioned and with a careful driver, a vital criteria for me on all levels.\nThe rather dry dusty visitors centre with a storks nest. Along the road almost every power pole had a stork’s nest – hundreds of them.\nThe town of El Rocío is quite something, it took me back to the days at the local picture theatre and spaghetti westerns , truely. The streets are pure sandy dirt, whilst cars abound, on weekends the horse rules and outside the pubs, bars and some houses are hitching rails. I would not have been surprised to see John Wayne swagger down the wide street as tumble weed was blown along by gusting hot prairie winds, and it was hot, believe me.\nThe rest of the day was spent slowly driving through the sandy scrub of the national park sadly the ecosystem destroyed last Century by the growing of eucalyptus plantations. We then arrived at the sand cliffs and dunes of the coast and the Atlantic Ocean, which I am forced to admit was rather a let down given the hype that preceded it. We do much better in Australia and especially South Australia and Kangaroo Island.\nAs we drove along it was explained to us all that we may be lucky and spy a lynx. It’s habitat was threatened , signs along the road urged caution lest the next lynx we see may be road kill. One could be forgiven therefore if one assumed that like the Australian kangaroo and wallaby, there would be a reasonable chance that we would come across an Iberian lynx. So we drove at walking pace almost, through sandy slippery roads in the forest looking eagerly left and right for about 90 long minutes, by which time the excitement and anticipation had worn rather thin!\nOh well sighed our otherwise excellent guide, they are mostly nocturnal and then, wait for it, he further explained, the current head count of the number of living Iberian Lynx in the Donana National Park is 11. Yes that is ELEVEN. Now let’s indulge in some mathematics here. The area of this National Park is 540 sq Km that’s 540,000,000 sq metres, divide that by 11, and you will understand that we had as much chance of coming across an Iberian Lynx, as I have of bouncing my bum on the moon.\nI had two beers when I got back to civilisation and Seville.\nThe Plaza de España (“Spain Square”, in English) is a plaza in the Parque de María Luisa (Maria Luisa Park), in Seville, Spain, built in 1928 for the Ibero-American Exposition of 1929. It is a landmark example of the Regionalism Architecture, mixing elements of the Renaissance Revival and Moorish Revival (Neo-Mudéjar) styles of Spanish architecture.\nThe above paragraph is a cut and paste from Wikipedia which I acknowledge and the whole point is that I was gobsmacked to learn the whole delightful complex was built in 1929 , not hundreds of years ago. It is a delightful and very impressive “space”.\nThe Museum Park of Seville.\nIt is indeed worthy of that name and has an overall atmosphere similar to the Art Gallery of SA, albeit on a much smaller scale. The most famous painter of Seville was Murillo, about whom I knew absolutely nothing until today.\nThe handsome security guard indicated that I should place my backpack in a locker, then with a somewhat unexpected giggle pointed in the general direction of my crutch and in sign language made it obvious that I should tuck it in. I gasped and for a momentary modest minute assumed my fly was unzipped (an increasingly common failing I admit). However thankfully he twiddled with the elastic long lanyard that secures my iPhone to trouser waist and thence into pocket. It was indeed dangling on my outer thigh. He giggled some more and did a charming demonstration of a pirouette of his hips, worthy of any picador to make the point that were I perchance to swivel in close proximity to a naked male marble statue, I may at worst catch the lanyard on it and bring it crashing down around me. Suitably touched and admonished, I did as told and meandered safely amongst the marble.\nis a basic simple museum that explores aspects of Spanish life over the last few centuries- it had the feel of the delightful museums that are lovingly maintained by volunteers of the local historical society in the country towns and villages of Australia. Perhaps more professionally curated though.\nSkip the Queues Seville Style.\nI signed up for a Skip the queue tour of the Seville Palace, Gardens and Cathedral. It seems that most towns in Andalucía have an understandable multicultural society going back over many centuries. Given that Africa, specifically Morocco, is but a few kilometres across the ocean from the southern most outpost of Spain, it is not surprising. “Stopping the Boats” was an impossible catch cry. Hence over Millenia, hordes of Arabs (Muslims) invaded Spain, to be then overrun by Christian hordes and so it alternated between these cultures. Forts, Palaces, Mosques were thankfully mostly not destroyed but “modified” by the Christian Kings.\nTo my eye, there is much beauty in Islamic architecture with its delicate complex mosaics and blue and aquamarine colours. The mosques were huge open plan areas of worship surrounded by an oasis of green gardens and wonderful use of natural light. Sadly the Christian conquests saw darkness descend literally and figuratively as they bricked up the arches and constructed ornate cathedrals within the mosque.\nChristian kings live in the palace and to their credit, additions and modifications were mostly in the Islamic style.\nAs to the cathedral, only a few pictures.\nActually poor Columbus wished to be buried in the New World, but Spain wanted him for themselves. Over the centuries his remains were frequently exhumed and transported to various locations around the world so much so that eventually upon his return to Spain, specifically, Seville, poor Christopher was in small pieces! Hence inside the huge casket in the cathedral of Seville, there is a bit of him. On the 500th anniversary of his discovery (1992) it was rather unsettling to the civic fathers who were about to spend millions of dollars on fireworks, so poor Christopher was again exhumed and his DNA compared to the DNA of his great grandson. To the utter relief of all concerned, the DNA matched, so the thimble full of dust that is Christopher Columbus’ presumed left big toe , was safely returned to the casket and in 1992, millions of dollars of fireworks went up in smoke.\nAnd a few street shots. Seville orange trees are as ubiquitous as eucalyptus trees in Adelaide. The oranges are inedible- much too bitter and used for jam.\nThere are more taxis in Seville than pigeons! There are more pigeons than ice cream shops, but only marginally.\nBeing rushed off my feet by my 2 travel companions, my creative juices cope with a daily hour of Recorder practice at the expense of any creative writing. I humbly apologise for this lapse. Pictures must sadly suffice.\nHaving arrived in Seville after a rapid 40 minute train ride from Cordoba, settled in, meandered in the dusk and then the next day took a day trip to Ronda. This delightful hill top town is quite unique and home to many famous English personalities including Ernest Hemingway.\nRonda has the largest and possibly oldest bullring in Spain, which if you are the sort of person who buys barnyard eggs, you would understandably find offensive, if you get my drift? There is now only one bullfight a year on 1st September. The trip was on the first rainy day of the holiday and was simply autumnal drizzle.\nRonda means if you best guessed, “round” ! It’s perched on a hilltop with a gut wrenching view over a ravine and a “new bridge” which to my eye appeared disconcertingly ancient."}

He says they'll be paid once they return but safety isn't guaranteed as he's only done this once before. A magazine writer (Jake Johnson) hears about the story and takes a long a couple interns, one named Darius (Aubrey Plaza), quickly gets caught up with the time traveler as she applies for the job without him knowing that she's actually on a job. SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED is a pretty strange film to classify because it's part comedy and there are certainly some very light moments but the film also has a tremendous heart, which lets the characters actually be characters and this leads to some pretty dramatic moments. I guess the best way to classify this film is just by calling it life because it pretty much has a little bit of everything in it. What I found so good about the picture is simply how cute and charming it actually is. The reporters go into this story expecting to find a crazy man because we all know that time travel can't happen. What works so well with the film is the fact that you makes you believe that these type of things are possible and you really get caught up with all the characters and their situations. By the time the movie is over, and I won't spoil the ending, you're leaving the theater with a smile on your face no matter what your brain might tell you afterwards. Duplass and Plaza are simply perfect together as both of them bring the weirdness and loneliness out of their characters but they also have such a warm and wonderful chemistry that you can't help but fall for both of them. I also thought Johnson was extremely good in his supporting role as is Karan Soni as the other intern. SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED is really a magical little gem that is a breath of fresh air if you're wanting to get away from the loud blockbusters of the summer."}

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "The respondent in this appeal entered into a hire purchase agreement with the defenders on 9 March 2001 for the hire and subsequent purchase of a 4.6 litre Range Rover motor vehicle, LMR 72, which was a new top-of-the-range automatic model. It was sold to the defenders by the appellants. The total cash price, as appears from the hire purchase agreement, was £51,550. The respondent paid a deposit of £6,717.82. In terms of the agreement, the respondent was due to pay a total of 36 monthly instalments, the first of which was of £1,517.80, subsequent instalments being of £1,422.80. The respondent paid the deposit and the first two instalments. These sums total £9,658.42.\n(1) To find and declare that the hire purchase agreement dated 9 March 2001 between the parties is rescinded and the pursuer's obligations thereunder are at an end.\n(2) To grant decree against the defenders for payment to the pursuer of the sum of £9,857.42, payable with interest thereon at the rate of 8% per annum from citation to follow hereon until payment with expenses; and to grant warrant to arrest on the dependence.\nThe sum sued for in the second crave represented the deposit and the first two instalments which the respondent had paid under the hire purchase agreement, together with the cost of a telephone system, which the respondent had had fitted to the dashboard of the vehicle, which amounted to £199. This had not been returned to him following upon the rescission of the contract.\n The respondent's case was that the Range Rover vehicle was not of satisfactory quality, particularly having regard to the price paid for it. In his pleadings, he averred that the vehicle, when delivered, had several defects. He maintained that, when driven, it pulled to the left, causing undue tyre wear. Because of the layout of the pedals, his foot had become trapped underneath the brake pedal. His foot had caught on the underside of the fascia panel. Because the pedals were positioned incorrectly, the vehicle was not safe to drive. There was a loud noise from either the engine or the transmission system. The respondent also maintained that there was a deep scratch on the ashtray and that the glove box was obviously incorrectly fitted. The respondent averred that a reasonable person would expect to receive a vehicle free of such defects. Accordingly, by letter dated 30 March 2001, the respondent rejected the vehicle. It was in these circumstances that he sought the remedies described.\n\"For safety reasons, there was a height difference between the pedals to prevent pivoting. Pivoting is not good driving practice.\"\n The sheriff also found that the respondent had validly rejected the vehicle by the letter dated 30 March 2001 and had not invalidated his rejection by continuing to drive the vehicle for a period of time thereafter, nor by paying instalments. The vehicle had been uplifted from the respondent early in June 2001, by which time it appeared to have been driven nearly 6,000 miles. The sheriff had concluded that the motor vehicle was not unsafe and that the respondent had exaggerated all his complaints. The appellants had been prepared to replace the foot pedals, the ashtray cover and the navigation disk, to rectify the alignment of the glove box and to re-test the steering alignment. So far as the transmission noise was concerned, the sheriff found in finding-in-fact 16 that \"they were prepared to check this and repair it if required.\" The sheriff had also found that the appellants had been prepared to carry out all of the necessary work without any charge to the respondent and at a time convenient to him, but the latter had refused to accept their offer.\n(a) The front wheels were incorrectly balanced, causing excessive tyre wear. This had been corrected by balancing of the front wheels in March 2001. The steering geometry of the motor vehicle was also corrected, as appears from paragraphs 342 and 343 of the sheriff's Note.\n(b) There was road speed related noise emanating from the transmission or drive system. This fault was rectified by the appellants at a much later date than the rejection of the motor vehicle by the respondent, following its re-purchase by the appellants, by replacing the front differential, a task which took about two hours.\n(c) There was a scratch on the ashtray cover.\n(d) There was misalignment of the glove box.\n(e) There was poorly finished paintwork on parts of the roof of the vehicle.\n The sheriff concluded in finding-in-fact 23 that, notwithstanding these defects, the vehicle was of \"satisfactory quality\" in terms of the Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act 1973, as amended. She found that the defects were easy to rectify and that they would have been covered by the Land Rover warranty. She also found that such repairs \"would not affect the durability, longevity or value of the vehicle\". On the basis that the vehicle was of satisfactory quality, she found that the defenders were not in material breach of contract and that the respondent had not been entitled to reject the vehicle. Accordingly the defenders were absolved from liability. Accordingly she sustained the third and sixth pleas-in-law for the defenders; quoad ultra repelled the respondent's and defenders' pleas-in-law; assoilzied the defenders; and found the respondent liable to the defenders in the expenses of the cause.\n\"23. The vehicle supplied to the pursuer was of satisfactory quality. Any defects were easy to rectify and would be covered by the Land Rover warranty. The pursuer would not incur any cost in said repairs being carried out and they would not effect (sic.) the durability, longevity or value of the vehicle.\n24. The pursuer acted totally unreasonably in refusing to accept Shields' offers to remedy any alleged defects. He also acted in a totally unreasonable manner in refusing to accept the defenders' attempts to have matters rectified. The vehicle being of satisfactory quality, the defenders were not in material breach of contract. The pursuer was not entitled to reject the said vehicle.\"\n\"25. The vehicle was supplied to the pursuer in terms of the hire purchase agreement with the foregoing defects. The defect in the differential was not a minor defect. It required to be and was later replaced. The defenders were in material breach of contract by hiring the vehicle in that condition to the pursuer. The pursuer was entitled to reject the vehicle and claim damages.\"\n\"1. The defenders, having hired to the pursuer a vehicle which was not of satisfactory quality and being in material breach of contract, the pursuer was entitled to reject it and treat the hire purchase agreement dated 9 March 2001 as repudiated.\n2. The pursuer is entitled to repayment of his deposit and of the instalments paid by him in terms of that agreement, i.e. to repayment of the sum of £9,658.42.\"\nThereafter he sustained the fourth, fifth, sixth, ninth, tenth and eleventh pleas-in-law for the pursuer; quoad ultra he repelled the pleas-in-law for the pursuer and the defenders. He went on to ordain the defenders to pay to the pursuer the sum of £9,658.42, with interest thereon at the rate of 8% per annum from 10 July 2001 until payment. He found the defenders liable to the pursuer in the expenses of the cause, save so far as previously decerned for. Against the sheriff principal's decision, the appellants have now appealed to this court.\n Junior counsel for the appellants indicated that his submissions would relate to five aspects of the case: (1) he would examine the judgments of the sheriff principal and the sheriff; (2) he would consider the extent of the defects in the motor vehicle; (3) he would set out the law applicable to the situation; (4) he would deal with the tests which an appeal court should apply in relation to findings-in-fact made by a judge of first instance; in particular, this would be considered in the context of findings relating to \"satisfactory quality\"; and (5) he would make submissions relating to the decision of the sheriff principal to the effect that (a) he should not have substituted his own view for that of the sheriff; (b) upon the assumption that he was entitled to interfere with the decision of the sheriff, in doing so he applied the wrong test; and (c) the sheriff principal made a judgment on a critical issue without taking into account the full content of the evidence.\n Following that pattern of submissions, junior counsel first drew attention to paragraphs 27-33 of the sheriff principal's judgment, in which it was contended that, while he had identified the correct test, he had applied it wrongly. In this connection he submitted that a warranty was a relevant factor to be taken into account in relation to the decision of the hypothetical \"reasonable person\" referred to in section 10(2A) of the 1973 Act. In paragraph 30 of his judgment the sheriff principal had held that the warranty was, in effect, irrelevant. That was an erroneous view on account of the reference in section 10(2A) of the 1973 Act to \"all the other relevant circumstances\". In paragraph 32 of his judgment, the sheriff principal had set forth the function of an appellate court in a case in which a judge of first instance had made findings-in-fact. No issue was taken with that, save that the sheriff principal should have made clear that it was only in the circumstances outlined that an appellate court could interfere. Junior counsel went on to examine the remaining paragraphs of the sheriff principal's decision, making a number of points regarding the manner in which they had been stated. In paragraph 50, the sheriff principal had erred in law. In that paragraph, while drawing attention to the \"reasonable person\" referred to in section 10(2A) of the 1973 Act, he had gone on in the latter part of the paragraph to refer to \"an objective purchaser\". That was an erroneous formulation. The \"reasonable person\" was an hypothetical person, who had to be seen as an outsider looking into the transaction, not a party to it, as contemplated by the sheriff principal. However, it was accepted that there was little authority in relation to the application of section 10 of the 1973 Act. It was appropriate to mention in relation to the decision of the sheriff principal that the criticism made of the pedal arrangement in the vehicle, of the ashtray and the missing navigation disk had been rejected.\n In relation to the judgment of the sheriff, paragraphs 343-346 of her Note were crucial. It was in these paragraphs that the vital conclusions of the sheriff had been expressed, including the conclusion that the vehicle had been of satisfactory quality. The sheriff's finding-in-fact 5 related to the Land Rover warranty which was found to enable manufacturing and mechanical defects in the vehicle to be rectified free of charge to the pursuer during the three year period of its duration.\n Junior counsel next proceeded to consider the extent of the defects in the motor vehicle, the second part of his submissions. As already made clear, it was not necessary to explore the situation regarding the ashtray and the navigation disk. He drew attention to the sheriff's findings-in-fact 7, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22, which set out the sheriff's conclusions regarding the defects. The sheriff principal had dealt with these matters in paragraph 49 of his judgment, but it was not clear what defects the sheriff principal had accepted as being significant. It was of some interest to note that the respondent's letter of rejection of 30 March 2001 did not mention a number of the defects subsequently founded upon, in particular, the defect in the transmission. However, it had to be accepted that that had to be taken into account nevertheless in applying the test set forth in section 10(2A) of the 1973 Act.\n Junior counsel turned next to the third part of the submissions, his exposition of the law applicable to the case. The present form of section 10 of the 1973 Act was a consequence of amendment effected by the Sale and Supply of Goods Act 1994, the purpose of which had been to strengthen the position of consumers. Section 7 of, and Schedule 2 to, the 1994 Act had made amendments to the 1973 Act. The 1994 Act had followed the making of certain recommendations by the Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission in a Report on the sale and supply of goods presented to Parliament in May 1987 (Law Com. No. 160; Scot. Law Com. No. 104). It was instructive to consider the contents of that Report, in particular paragraphs 3.21-3.24 and 3.42 and 3.43. Nowhere did one see any reference to the \"objective purchaser\" concept of the sheriff principal.\n Junior counsel for the appellants then moved on to the fourth section of his submissions, the appropriate tests to be applied by an appeal court where findings-in-fact had been made by a judge of first instance. It was accepted that the question of whether goods met \"the standard that a reasonable person would regard as satisfactory\", referred to in section 10(2A) of the 1973 Act, as amended, was essentially a jury question to be answered in the light of the whole circumstances of the particular case, as was recognised by the sheriff principal in paragraph 31 of his judgment. However, that recognition did not detract from the limitations upon the powers of an appeal court, which were circumscribed. In this connection junior counsel relied upon Thomas v Thomas 1947 S.C.(H.L.) 45 per Lord Thankerton at page 54; Millars of Falkirk Ltd v Turpie 1976 S.L.T. (N.) 66, per Lord President Emslie at page 68 and Lord Avonside at page 69; and Thomson v Kvaerner Govan Ltd 2004 S.C. (H.L.) 1, per Lord Hope of Craighead at pages 5-6.\n Junior counsel came finally to the fifth part of his submissions. In the first place, it was contended that the sheriff principal had, but should not have, substituted his own views for those of the sheriff. In that respect the present case bore striking similarity to that of Millars of Falkirk Ltd v Turpie, although it was recognised that the issue in that case had been whether the goods concerned, a new motor car, were of \"merchantable quality\". The source of the trouble in that case had been a minor matter which could readily have been cured with great ease and at little expense. The court had held in that case that the sheriff principal ought not to have taken a different view from the sheriff, who had been entitled to reach the conclusion he did.\n The heart of the sheriff principal's decision here was to be found in paragraphs 48 and 49 of his judgment. It was submitted that the reasoning was not particularly clear. In particular, it was not clear whether he was saying that the sheriff had been plainly wrong in taking the view she did. Further, it was not clear that he was saying that she had misdirected herself as regards the law. It was possible that the sheriff principal was saying that the sheriff had taken into account an irrelevant consideration, namely that, in her view, the respondent was not a reasonable person. Reliance was placed on the concluding part of paragraph 48. The sheriff principal did not seem to have reached a definite conclusion about the sheriff's reasoning and, in particular, whether she had adopted the correct test. In paragraph 48 of his judgment, the sheriff principal had said that the sheriff appeared to have attached great significance to the facts that (a) the pursuer was not a reasonable person, (b) the defects were minor, (c) they could be remedied under warranty at no cost to the pursuer, and (d) Shields were prepared to carry out remedial work. In saying that, the sheriff principal had ignored certain features of the sheriff's Note. It was clear from paragraph 344 that section 10(2A) of the 1973 Act was important. What she had subsequently said in paragraph 345 concerning the pursuer amounted in fact to the application of the appropriate tests.\n The sheriff principal had drawn attention to the fact that the sheriff had allegedly regarded the defects as minor. It was submitted that that did not in fact reflect her findings. The classification of defects into major and minor defects was not part of the scheme of the legislation. There could be a myriad of minor defects which would render a car of unsatisfactory quality. There could be no objection to the language used by the sheriff to describe the defects if in fact she had applied the correct criterion. That she had done.\n In paragraph 30 of the sheriff principal's judgment, he dealt with the significance of the warranty. It was correct to say that the warranty did not detract from the rights of the hirer, but it was nevertheless a relevant circumstance, for the purposes of section 10(2A) of the 1973 Act. The significance of it was a matter for the judge of first instance. In any event the sheriff principal was ambivalent on the matter of the warranty. In this connection junior counsel relied upon Rogers &c v Parish (Scarborough) Ltd  1 Q.B. 933, at pages 941, 944 and 945. It was accepted that that case had been one involving the issue of whether a vehicle was of \"merchantable quality\" within the meaning of section 14 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979. The sheriff principal, in paragraph 47 of his judgment, had derived comfort from the observations of Mustill, L.J. at pages 944 and 945 of the case cited. However, what had been said by him there was not consistent with Millars of Falkirk Ltd v Turpie. Accordingly, the law was uncertain as to the extent to which, if at all, a warranty was relevant to an issue such as had arisen in this case. If the view advanced by Mustill, L.J. were correct and applicable in the context of this case, then the sheriff may have misdirected herself in law.\n At this stage in his submissions, junior counsel for the appellants turned to the issue of whether the sheriff had been plainly wrong in relation to the defects founded upon in the case. In that connection he considered the significance of the ashtray, the missing navigation disk, the glove box, the paintwork on the roof and the differential problem. The two former items could not be founded upon by the respondent, for the reasons already given. The sheriff dealt with the glove box in paragraph 333 of her Note. It could not be said that her approach there was plainly wrong. Likewise, she dealt with the allegations concerning the paintwork in paragraph 336 of the note. Once again she could not be said to have been plainly wrong in relation to that matter. The fault in the differential mechanism was dealt with in finding-in-fact 19 and paragraph 337 of the sheriff's Note. Nothing had been done about this problem prior to the rejection of the motor vehicle. While the problem would have become a very serious one with continuing use, it did not have an effect on the roadworthiness of the vehicle. It had not been mentioned in the letter of rejection. There had been evidence from a Mr Bathgate that the transmission problem, the source of noise, could have been attended to quite easily and was not a major problem. Looking at all of these matters, it could not be said that the sheriff was plainly wrong in her assessment of the evidence. It could not be said that a reasonable person could not have reached the same view as the sheriff on the whole matter. It followed that the sheriff principal ought not to have interfered with the decision of the sheriff.\n In the second place it was submitted that, even if the sheriff principal had been entitled to interfere with the sheriff's judgment, he appeared to have applied the wrong test. In paragraph 50 of his judgment he had referred to the concept of \"an objective purchaser\", about which a submission had already been made. That concept was not reflected in anything to be found in the relevant legislation. What was in contemplation in the legislation was the test of the reasonable person who looked in on the transaction without being a party to it.\n In the third place, junior counsel contended that the sheriff principal had, in any event, made a judgment on a critical issue without taking into account the full content of the evidence. His assessment of the evidence in paragraph 50 of his judgment was unsound. In that paragraph he referred to the level of price attached to the vehicle in question and to the fact that it was sold as \"a high quality vehicle\". The sheriff principal had misconstrued the evidence in this connection, although it was accepted that, in principle, price and what might be called brand image were relevant to the issue of \"satisfactory quality\", within the meaning of section 10(2) of the 1973 Act. In particular the sheriff principal had not assessed the evidence regarding the expectations of a reasonable person in relation to an expensive up-market car. In connection with this submission junior counsel referred to the evidence of a number of witnesses, in particular, Angus Robertson at pages 245, 246 and 249 of the printed evidence; Alan Bathgate at pages 352, 355 and 424; Graham Alexander at pages 535, 544 and 556; Robert Woods at pages 693, 694, 732 and 751; Christopher Bradley at pages 840 and 842; Cameron Johnstone at pages 887-889, 1054 and 1055; and Andrew Grant at pages 1098-1099. On all of this material the submission was that the balance of the evidence did not support the sheriff principal's view that an expensive car could reasonably be expected to have no defects. In short, the balance of the evidence showed that a reasonable person would not expect that a new car would be free from defects, even if it was expensive. In particular the sheriff principal had made a decision contrary to the weight of the evidence of Alan Bathgate, Christopher Bradley and Andrew Grant. In conclusion, junior counsel moved the court to recall the interlocutor of the sheriff principal and to restore the judgment of the sheriff.\n Counsel for the respondent moved the court to adhere to the interlocutor of the sheriff principal and to dismiss the appeal. The question raised was whether the defenders were in material breach of contract as at 30 March 2001, when the respondent treated the contract as having been repudiated. That led to the question of whether the motor vehicle was of \"satisfactory quality\" within the meaning of section 10(2) of the 1973 Act. That question reduced itself into the issue of whether, at the date of delivery, 9 March 2001, the defenders had hired a motor vehicle of satisfactory quality, thus meeting the standards of the reasonable person, taking into account all of the relevant factors. These issues were focused in the pursuer's pleas-in-law, particularly pleas 10, 11 and 12.\n Counsel went on to traverse the cases of Thomas v Thomas and Thomson v Kvaerner Govan Ltd; also Gray v Gray 1968 S.C. 185 per Lord Cameron at page 197 and Stevenson v Rogers 1991 S.C. 164, at page 174. The gravamen of the respondent's submission was that the sheriff had misdirected herself in the application of the law, in relation to the manufacturer's warranty and the fact that the appellants had supplied a motor vehicle which everyone concluded was in need of a warranty repair. It was submitted that the sheriff principal had in fact recognised the limitations of his jurisdiction in a case such as this, in paragraph 32 of his judgment. The respondent's position was that the sheriff principal had correctly concluded that the sheriff had misdirected herself in law by taking into account irrelevant considerations and failing to take into account relevant matters.\n An important point was that the appellants had not made clear in their submissions when it was that they were saying that they had implemented their obligations in terms of the 1973 Act, as amended. It was submitted that, unless there was some agreement to the contrary, the test set forth in section 10 of that Act had to be satisfied at the moment of delivery. If that were correct, the warranty would disappear from the case.\n(1) The test of \"satisfactory quality\" to be applied in terms of section 10(2) of the 1973 Act was to be applied according to the objective standard of the \"reasonable person\", referred to in section 10(2A) of that Act, that reasonable person being involved in an hypothetical evaluation of the goods hired under the contract, rendering the subjective standards of the individual hirer irrelevant.\n(2) The objective standard of \"satisfactory quality\" encompassed a need to consider the quality of the goods in relation to several different aspects of characteristics of the goods; when looked at together, it must be possible to say that the standard of the \"reasonable person\" was attained.\n(3) In a consumer contract, subject to sections 10-12 of the 1973 Act, delivery of the goods was performance by the \"creditor\" in the hire purchase contract and a material breach of contract in performance at the date of the delivery gave rise to a right in the hirer, or debtor, to treat the contract as having been repudiated by the \"creditor\".\n(4) The existence of a manufacturer's warranty in a consumer contract was not a relevant circumstance in terms of section 10(2A) of the 1973 Act in the assessment of the quality of the goods because (i) the term implied by section 10(2) fell to be implemented by the \"creditor\"; (ii) a warranty was an arrangement with a third party which was not directly enforceable against the \"creditor\"; and (iii) the assessment of quality was to be made at the date of supply and not at the time of completion of warranty repairs, save as otherwise agreed. In any event, having regard to the terms of clause 6(b) of the hire purchase agreement, it was difficult to see how the warranty could have been of any avail to the respondent until the duration of the period of hire had expired.\n(5) In a consumer contract, an opportunity to cure a defect might be afforded to the \"creditor\", but that would be at the option of the hirer. Its exercise in any particular contract might be a \"relevant circumstance\" in terms of section 10(2A) in the assessment of quality, if there had been an attempt to cure a defect which had failed.\n\"The pursuer acted totally unreasonably in refusing to accept Shields' offers to remedy any alleged defects. He also acted in a totally unreasonable manner in refusing to accept the defenders' attempts to have matters rectified.\"\nOne had to ask why findings in those terms had been made. There could be no other explanation than that the sheriff had applied the wrong test. In addition, there were no findings-in-fact or findings-in-fact and law to the effect of what a reasonable person would have done in the circumstances. The terms of paragraphs 317, 318 and 338 in the sheriff's Note showed that she had gone off the rails. The focus of those paragraphs was the sheriff's assessment that the respondent had behaved unreasonably in a number of different respects. Paragraph 345 was also unsatisfactory. There was no reference to section 10(2B) of the 1973 Act, nor was there any reasoning. In particular the sheriff did not appear to have had in mind matters of \"appearance and finish\" and \"freedom from minor defects\", which featured in section 10(2B).\n In connection with his proposition (2), counsel submitted that section 10(2A) and 10(2B) had to be read together; the sheriff should have looked at the issue of \"satisfactory quality\" in the light of the factors set out in section 10(2B). Those matters should have been assessed according to the standard of the \"reasonable person\", but that had not been done. In this context counsel drew attention to paragraphs 3.28 to 3.43 in the Law Commissions' Report. It was quite clear that the Scottish Law Commission had taken an adverse view of the effect of the decision in Millars of Falkirk Ltd v Turpie. Counsel also relied on Benjamin's Sale of Goods, 6th ed. paragraphs 11.050, 11.052 and 11.062.\n Counsel went on to elaborate his proposition (3) by submitting that the test of \"satisfactory quality\" had to be applied at the date of delivery of the goods hired. That was evident from an examination of the hire purchase contract itself. It was necessary that the goods hired should demonstrate the requisite quality as at the commencement of the hire period. So, if the goods required a warranty repair to achieve the prescribed standard, that meant that the implied term as to quality had been breached. The matter of remedies for breach of a hire purchase agreement as regards Scotland were dealt with in section 12A of the 1973 Act. In paragraph 346 of her Note, the sheriff appeared to have overlooked the provisions of section 12A(2)(a). It provided that, if there was a breach by the creditor of any term, express or implied, as to the quality of the goods, that breach was deemed to be material. The sheriff's reference to section 12A(2)(b) was plainly inaccurate. In connection with these submissions, counsel relied upon Crowther v Shannon Motor Company  1 All E.R. 139; Lee v York Coach and Marine  R.T.R. 35 at page 42; Rogers v Parish (Scarborough) Ltd at page 943 and J. & H. Ritchie Ltd v Lloyd Ltd 2005 S.C. 155. All of these cases showed that the punctum temporis at which quality had to be assessed was either the point of sale, or where a hire was involved, the point at which the hire commenced. The fact that the sheriff had made finding-in-fact 23, which referred to the rectification of defects under a warranty, indicated that she had misunderstood the law. The sheriff had looked at the question of whether the vehicle could be rendered to be in a satisfactory condition after work had been done on it. That was an erroneous approach.\n Counsel next proceeded to elaborate his proposition (4), essentially to the effect that the warranty was not a \"relevant circumstance\" in terms of section 10(2A) of the 1973 Act. A hirer who had defective goods, who was faced with a non-compliant manufacturer, would have no remedy against the creditor in the hire purchase agreement. In any event, in the present case, there was an insuperable difficulty concerning the enforcement of any warranty, having regard to the terms of clause 6(b) of the hire purchase agreement. Warranties might be issued for a number of commercial reasons, for example, public relations. A consumer might see a warranty as a positive benefit. However, a warranty was irrelevant in relation to quality because its existence did not relate to any aspect of the quality of the goods concerned. The expression \"all the other relevant circumstances\" in section 10(2A) had to refer to circumstances relevant to the quality and character of those goods. In its nature, a warranty was a collateral guarantee issued by the manufacturer concerning the goods, which might alleviate the fears of a purchaser. The features which figured in section 10(2B) militated against the relevance of any warranty in the present circumstances. On a practical aspect, it was pointed out that the terms of the warranty in the present case had never been seen. The document was not produced. Evidently the sheriff had made assumptions about its contents. It was obvious that the express wording of the warranty would be of importance, if it were to be relied upon. That was another reason why the making of finding-in-fact 23 was unjustified. Further, in terms of clause 9(e) of the hire purchase agreement, the defenders were not bound by any representation made by the appellants. The respondent had no contractual link with the manufacturer of the motor vehicle and could not rely on any representations made by the appellants. The observations of Mustill, L.J. at pages 944 and 955 in Rogers v Parish (Scarborough) Ltd and of Sir Edward Eveleigh at page 947 were pertinent. It appeared that the sheriff had had no regard to those opinions. In connection with the same point, counsel relied upon Chitty on Contracts 29th ed. paragraph 43.155 and Benjamin's Sale of Goods, 6th ed. paragraphs 11.043, 11.050 , 11.057, 14.043 and 14.062. These passages demonstrated that statutory rights ought not to be interpreted by reference to the existence of a warranty. The sheriff had done just that. Finally, counsel relied on Hunter v Wylie, 1993 S.L.T. 1091. The fact that the fault could easily be remedied did not affect its character.\n Counsel, noting that Millars of Falkirk Ltd v Turpie had figured prominently in the submissions for the appellants, made a number of points concerning that case. In particular, since its decision, the law had changed; the Sale of Goods Act 1893, as amended, had been in force at the time of the decision. The issue had been one of \"merchantable quality\". Having regard to the fundamental changes in the law which had occurred since the decision of that case, it was of no assistance here.\n Counsel went on to draw attention to tracts of evidence relating to the differential mechanism of the motor vehicle. It was plain from the evidence that there was a defect in a major component of the vehicle. In relation to that defect, the sheriff's conclusion, in paragraph 337 of her Note, that it was easily rectified, demonstrated a misdirection in law. If for no other reason, clause 9(i) of the hire purchase agreement demonstrated the irrelevance of the warranty to the issue of whether the respondent's statutory rights had been breached or not. Counsel also relied upon Jewsons Ltd v Leanne Boykan  B.L.R. 31 at pages 44 and 45.\n Counsel proceeded next to elaborate his proposition (5). If the existence of the warranty was relevant, or if the ease of cure of a defect was relevant, or if the willingness of the third party to cure a problem was relevant, then the respondent's attempts to have the vehicle rectified had to be taken into account also as a relevant circumstance. Looking at findings-in-fact 7, 8, 9, 19 and 20, the third party's performance in attempting to deal with the defects left much to be desired. In particular the problem in the transmission system of the vehicle was never rectified while it was on hire to the respondent. In this connection counsel drew attention to paragraphs 28, 117, 118, 119, 161 and 319 of the sheriff's Note. Thus, if endeavours to cure the defects were relevant, the progress made was not satisfactory. There was resistance by the third party to requests for action by them. Counsel also relied upon passages in Benjamin's Sale of Goods: Special Supplement to the 6th ed. at paragraphs 1.007, 1.015, 1.160, 1.200, and 1.204 to 1.206.\n Counsel contended that the test was whether a reasonable person would have accepted the vehicle with the defects identified, or rejected it. It was plain from the evidence that the defects justified rejection by a reasonable person, particularly the problem with the transmission system. In this connection, counsel drew attention to the evidence of the witnesses who had dealt with those issues at the proof, namely, Angus Robertson, Alan Bathgate, Graham Alexander, Robert Woods, and Cameron Johnstone. There was no factual basis for the appellants' submissions that a consumer would expect defects such as those which emerged in the present case, nor would the \"reasonable person\" referred to in section 10(2A) of the 1973 Act. The price of the vehicle and its status as a top-of-the-range vehicle reinforced that point. Thus the sheriff principal, having concluded that the sheriff had erred in law, was justified in reaching the conclusion that he did. The only contrary evidence came from Christopher Bradley, a technical manager for Land Rover and Jaguar cars. That evidence could not properly be the basis of a judgment.\n Turning finally to the judgment of the sheriff principal, counsel said that, in paragraph 27, he had correctly stated the issues which arose. In paragraphs 48 and 49 he had indicated where the sheriff had erred in law. The decision of the sheriff principal ought to be affirmed.\n Senior counsel began by adopting the submissions of junior counsel. He explained that he wished first to clarify certain points regarding the appellants' position. Thereafter he intended to reinforce the three principal submissions made by junior counsel in relation to the decision of the sheriff principal.\n Proceeding in that way, he made four points regarding the appellants' position. First, it was not said that, once there had been a breach of the implied term regarding quality, the appellants thereafter had an opportunity to remedy the breach; he was not relying on the concept of a \"remedial breach of contract\". So, if the judgment were made that the vehicle was not of \"satisfactory quality\", the warranty could not excuse that breach. Secondly, he accepted that the court had to proceed on the basis that quality had to be judged as at the time of delivery; however, that was subject to certain qualifications which would later emerge. Thirdly, the appellants submitted that there was no breach of the statutory implied term, unless the vehicle was not of \"satisfactory quality\"; but \"satisfactory quality\" was not to be equated with a complete absence of defects. Fourthly, the appellants argued that not every defect that required rectification would make a complex piece of machinery, such as the motor vehicle here involved, not of \"satisfactory quality\". It was a question of fact and degree whether a defect, or defects, amounted to a breach of the implied term. It had been argued for the respondent that, if there was a defect that required rectification, the goods were not of \"satisfactory quality\". Putting the matter in another way, unrepaired defects might be consistent with the existence of \"satisfactory quality\". An example of a defect which would not impair quality was a poor connection between the battery of the vehicle and the relevant electrical leads. In such a situation, the vehicle would not start; however, the matter could be rectified in a moment.\n Senior counsel then turned to elaborate the criticisms already made of the sheriff principal's judgment. He contended that the sheriff principal ought not to have interfered with the decision of the sheriff, substituting his view for hers. The sheriff had not misdirected herself on any material matter. Her decision was a decision on fact, although it had to be accepted that a judge could be responsible for a misdirection in making such a decision. If the issue was a pure question of fact, respect had to be accorded to the decision of the judge of first instance, although there was still an opportunity for review. Misdirection would include the adoption of an unsound legal approach. So, if the sheriff had erred in applying the provisions of section 10 of the 1973 Act, as amended, the sheriff principal and this Court would be justified in interfering.\n The decision in the present case involved the consideration of an hypothetical issue raised by the terms of section 10(2A) of the 1973 Act. That section did not define \"all the other relevant circumstances\". There was no statutory provision against taking the warranty into account in that context; a warranty might be a \"relevant circumstance\". However, it was accepted that the word \"circumstances\" had to be relevant to the issue of quality. The list of factors appearing in section 10(2B) was not a checklist; the elements in the list had to be considered and dealt with appropriately in all the circumstances. It was submitted that the sheriff had not ignored these matters. The list referred to did not have the effect of excluding other factors, for example, ease of repair.\n The approach of the sheriff principal to the sheriff's decision was to be found principally in paragraphs 48 and 49 of his judgment. In paragraph 48 he listed several alleged misdirections. Counsel for the respondent had identified several more. However, looking at the state of the vehicle, the decision of the sheriff was not perhaps surprising. In an area such as this, the issue depended on a matter of degree. The car worked and was roadworthy. The defects were few and minor. The sheriff had been entitled to come to the view that the defects were of this nature and had not troubled the respondent. It had been argued on his behalf that his view was irrelevant, but it was submitted that it could be taken into account in the context. Perhaps the most problematic defect was the fault in the differential. The sheriff principal had taken the view that this was not minor, as appeared from paragraph 49 of his judgment. In doing that, the sheriff principal was in error. In that connection senior counsel drew attention to findings-in-fact 15 and 19. This fault could be quickly and effectively repaired. It had not affected safety or roadworthiness. At this point in his submissions he sought to reinforce what he was saying by reference to certain parts of the evidence. It was submitted that the sheriff had had the correct test in mind when making her decision, as appeared from paragraphs 344 to 345 of her Note. Those passages were the culmination of a reasoning process set out in paragraph 236.\n It had been argued that the sheriff had taken into account allegedly irrelevant factors. The first of these was that the pursuer was not, in her view, a reasonable person. It was submitted that that was a part of the picture to which she was entitled to have regard. She had not confused the pursuer with the \"reasonable person\" referred to in section 10(2A) of the 1973 Act. Finding-in-fact 24, where she specifically found that the pursuer had acted totally unreasonably, was an unnecessary finding.\n It had been suggested that the sheriff's categorisation of the defects as minor indicated a misdirection on her part. However, that was an issue of fact, on which the sheriff principal had substituted his view for hers. In any event, the characterisation of a defect as major or minor was not the touchstone of quality as appeared from section 10 of the 1973 Act. Furthermore, in the crucial findings-in-fact 19 and 23, the sheriff had not used this characterisation. A defect such as the problem with the differential would not necessarily render the vehicle of unsatisfactory quality and it might therefore understandably be regarded as minor. In this connection, reference was made to Millars of Falkirk Ltd v Turpie. The defect under consideration in that case had been very similar to the one here referred to.\n The sheriff had been criticised by the sheriff principal for relying upon the existence of the warranty and upon the appellants' willingness to effect repairs. It had been said that she was not entitled to take those factors into account. Senior counsel submitted that she was. The weight given to them was for the sheriff herself to decide. There were four ways in which the warranty could be relevant. First, it had been sold as part of the contract for the acquisition of the vehicle. Senior counsel agreed that clause 6(b) of the hire purchase agreement was qualified, but the sheriff had felt able to make findings-in-fact 5 and 23. She must have relied on oral evidence for that purpose. Secondly, the warranty was relevant because it showed that a purchaser would expect some defects in a complicated vehicle and not perfection. It was relevant to the issue of the ease of remedying defects without cost to the consumer. Thirdly, the warranty was relevant because it led to the repair of any existing defects and the car dealer being willing and able to effect those repairs. Fourthly, the existence of the warranty was relevant in assessing whether any particular defect was sufficiently serious to render the vehicle not of satisfactory quality. As regards the appellants' willingness to repair the vehicle, that was relevant on the basis of the case of Millars of Falkirk Ltd v Turpie.\n Senior counsel acknowledged that findings-in-fact 5 and 23 had been made in the absence of evidence regarding the terms of the warranty. The document itself had not been before the court. The appellants had sought to lodge it during the proof, but that had been successfully opposed by the respondent. Oral evidence concerning it had been led without objection. The sheriff had been entitled to make findings on the basis of the evidence available to her. Senior counsel recognised that the decision in Rogers v Parish (Scarborough) Ltd presented a problem for his submissions. He sought to distinguish that case, since the defects there involved clearly made the car not of \"merchantable quality\". In any event, that case had been decided under the earlier law. It followed from that that the main significance of the case was as to the meaning of \"merchantable quality\". What Mustill, L.J. had said at page 944 was that a warranty was not able to make a vehicle of \"non-merchantable quality\" into one of \"merchantable quality\". That was an issue which arose only at a later stage than had been reached in the present case. At page 945 in the case there was a reference to the warranty being an addition to the buyer's rights, but those rights depended on the circumstances of the bargain. The sheriff here had considered that the warranty was relevant for the reasons explained in paragraph 346 of her Note. It would be of importance to the reasonable person to know that defects would be repaired free of charge, whether they would or would not affect the view taken of the importance of any particular defect. However, it was accepted that a line had to be drawn concerning the scale of defects, despite any warranty. The appellants' position was that useful guidance was to be obtained from Millars of Falkirk Ltd v Turpie. It was useful because there was an exercise of judgment in relation to defects in a motor vehicle, although, of course, the issue was one of \"merchantable quality\". The existence of the warranty was regarded as a relevant circumstance by the Lord President.\n It had been said in criticism of the sheriff that she had failed to take into account the circumstance that the vehicle was a new and luxury car. However, it was contended that she had made findings that showed that she had had that in mind. That appeared from paragraph 236 of her Note. It had also been submitted that the sheriff's reliance on the history of the car subsequent to its hiring to the respondent was reliance on an irrelevant matter. However, that was not so; finding-in-fact 19 was wholly pertinent to the issues in the case. The history showed how little had to be done to render the car of satisfactory quality. Senior counsel accepted that the law required that the vehicle had to be of satisfactory quality on delivery to the hirer. Finding-in-fact 23 reflected the fact that a vehicle with certain defects might yet be of satisfactory quality.\n Certain criticisms had been directed at the sheriff's decision in consequence of the appearance of the last two sentences in paragraph 346 of her Note. These sentences did not indicate misdirection in law by the sheriff. Her view was that the car was of \"satisfactory quality\". Accordingly there was no material breach. The sentences concerned did not show that the sheriff had misconstrued section 12A of the 1973 Act as amended. It was acknowledged that her reference to section 12A(2)(b) was erroneous; the reference should have been to section 12A(2)(a). There had also been criticism of the sheriff's reliance on Millars of Falkirk Ltd v Turpie. That case had already been discussed; there was no question of the sheriff having thought that it had been decided under the present law.\n The final criticism made of the sheriff was that she had failed to take account of the appellants' failure to have the transmission problem repaired. The fact was that there was no clear history of the transmission problem having been the subject of complaint by the respondent, which had been overlooked. In that connection, in paragraph 319 of her Note, the sheriff rejected the respondent's evidence at page 198 of the notes of evidence that he had been told that the noise emitted by the transmission was simply \"a characteristic of the vehicle\". Despite the contents of paragraph 337 of the sheriff's Note there was in fact no evidence that noise from the transmission had been brought to the attention of the appellants at an early stage. Transmission noise was not mentioned in the respondent's letter of rejection of 30 March 2001. There was no indication of material misdirection by the sheriff on these matters; accordingly the sheriff principal had not been entitled to interfere with her decision.\n Senior counsel moved on to the second of the criticisms made of the sheriff principal's decision, to the effect that, assuming that he had been entitled to interfere with the sheriff's decision and to consider the issue for himself, he had erred in the application of the appropriate test. This submission was focused on the use by the sheriff principal of the expression \"objective purchaser\", in paragraph 50 of his judgment. This expression was not just a shorthand method of referring to the test set out in section 10 of the 1973 Act; it appeared to be at the heart of the sheriff principal's reasoning and was wrong. The amendment to the 1973 Act had been designed to eliminate reference to a purchaser or hirer in defining the appropriate test. In that connection reference was made to paragraphs 3.21, 3.25 and 3.26 of the Law Commissions' Report. The sheriff principal's expression denoted some hypothetical purchaser, or, in this case hirer, who did not feature in the legislation. There was nothing in section 10(2A) to show that the intention of Parliament was that the \"reasonable person\" there employed was to be assumed to be in the position of a buyer or hirer. Section 10(2C) was focused on the position of the actual hirer.\n Turning to the third main criticism of the sheriff principal, to the effect that, even if he had applied the correct test, he did so without proper regard to the evidence on the matter, the factors on which he relied were apparently set out in paragraph 50 of his judgment. The sheriff principal did not explain where the material on which he relied in that paragraph had its origin. The only possible source was the evidence of Angus Robertson at pages 245-246 of the notes of evidence. The sheriff had noted that evidence in paragraph 255 of her Note. Alan Bathgate had given some evidence which tended to support the respondent's position at page 352 of the notes of evidence; however, he contemplated that the transmission unit would have been replaced under the warranty, if necessary, as appeared from page 425 of the notes of evidence. That was why new cars had warranties. Looking at the whole evidence including that of Christopher Bradley and of Andrew Grant, the evidence was not overwhelming. On balance, the evidence would support the sheriff's decision. In conclusion, senior counsel renewed the motion that the interlocutor of the sheriff principal should be recalled and that of the sheriff restored. Alternatively, the interlocutor of the sheriff principal should be recalled and decree of absolvitor pronounced.\n Counsel for the respondent stood by the submissions which he had earlier made. In reply to those of senior counsel for the appellants, he advanced three propositions: (1) if a car, as delivered, needed to have its condition changed to make it of \"satisfactory quality\", then it had been delivered in breach of contract, irrespective of the degree of failure; (2) section 12A of the 1973 Act provided that such a breach, irrespective of the degree of failure, would be deemed material; and (3) the existence of a warranty and the ease with which repairs might be effected were irrelevant to the assessment of whether goods which had been delivered were of \"satisfactory quality\" because (i) they were both means whereby the condition of the goods might be changed from that at delivery; and (ii) warranty defects were listed as factors or aspects of quality which might be taken into account in the assessment exercise required under section 10(2B) of the 1973 Act.\n Counsel accepted that some minor defects would be consistent with goods being of \"satisfactory quality\". Indeed, a vehicle could be of satisfactory quality with some minor defects which fell to be cured at the expense of the purchaser. In other words, the \"reasonable person\" of section 10(2A) would ignore a warranty in considering whether goods measured up to the requisite standard. The words \"all the other relevant circumstances\" in section 10(2A) could never include a warranty. Senior counsel for the appellants had figured a situation where a car had been bought of which the leads to the battery were not properly attached at the time of delivery. No doubt the car would not start. However, it would be a matter of a few moments to tighten the requisite bolts and to make a proper connection. That was an example of a defect where a \"reasonable person\" would conclude that he had been delivered a car which was of \"satisfactory quality\". The misdirection of the sheriff became clear when, on a natural reading, it emerged that it was her view that, provided that the car was put right in terms of a warranty, the purchaser or hirer would have had a car of \"satisfactory quality\". Findings-in-fact 23 and 24 were relevant. All that proceeded upon the basis that the supplier was entitled to an opportunity to cure such defects as existed. That approach was particularly evident from the terms of paragraphs 337, 338, 345 and 346 of the sheriff's Note. In short, the sheriff had assessed the problem as at the wrong time and on the wrong basis. In any event, the warranty in being was not part of a contract between the respondent and the appellants; there was no such contract. It was a part of a contract between the appellants and the defenders. The contents of paragraphs 342 and 343 of the sheriff's Note provided further evidence of misdirection. On any view, because the sheriff's judgment was defective, it should not be restored.\n It was quite clear that defects found to have existed in this case went beyond those which were consistent with the existence of \"satisfactory quality\". The tenor of the sheriff's decision was to recognise the existence of a remediable breach of contract, a concept eschewed by senior counsel for the appellants. The fact that a fair‑minded buyer might offer an opportunity to a supplier of goods to rectify defects in goods did not mean that the goods were originally of \"satisfactory quality\". It was necessary to look at all of the relevant circumstances in judging quality; that included the price and the \"state and condition\" of the goods in terms of section 10(2B) of the 1973 Act. The sheriff had failed to make any proper assessment of these matters in the light of the law. In this context the evidence of Angus Robertson was important. He contemplated that a new car would have a \"clean sheet\" report. A further point could be made about the approach of the sheriff, as reflected in paragraph 345 of her Note. It appeared that she attributed no importance to the appearance and finish of the vehicle. She seemed to have considered functionality only.\n The nature of the issue with which the sheriff had been faced was not a pure question of fact; it was a question of mixed fact and law. The consequence of that was that any appeal court had to consider a legal conclusion based upon primary facts. While the primary facts might be entitled to respect when found by a judge of first instance, the final decision was not, since the appeal court was in as good a position as the judge of first instance to make a decision on the application of the law to those facts. In these circumstances such cases as Thomas v Thomas and Thomson v Kvaerner Govan Ltd had no application here. If an error of law was evident in the sheriff's decision, that had to be the end of her determination.\n Senior counsel for the appellants had dwelt upon the scope of the expression \"all the other relevant circumstances\" used in section 10(2A) of the 1973 Act. While it was acknowledged that there was no definition of such circumstances, that did not mean that any circumstance was relevant. Only circumstances relevant to quality would be relevant.\n In conclusion, counsel summarised the submissions already made. His motion was that the appeal should be refused which failing, on the view that the court might conclude that the sheriff principal's judgment was in some way defective, his decision should be upheld for this court's own reasons.\n In our opinion, three main questions arise for our consideration in this appeal. These are: (1) whether the sheriff principal was entitled to interfere with the decision of the sheriff; (2) upon the assumption that he was entitled to interfere with that decision, whether he applied the correct legal test in formulating his own decision; and (3) whether the decision of the sheriff principal was warranted in the light of the acceptable evidence. It is these questions that we intend now to address.\n Counsel for the defenders contended that the answer to that question was in the affirmative. He pointed out that the sheriff had said in terms that that had been her approach and that applying that approach, she was in no doubt that the vehicle was of satisfactory quality. But it is clear from her findings and her Note that she attached great weight to the factors to which I have referred and particularly to the facts that the defects were remediable and that they could and probably would have been remedied under warranty. In these circumstances I do not consider that it can be said that the sheriff's approach was sound. There were several defects in this vehicle at the time of delivery, only some of which were minor. The pursuer was aware of two of these at the time of delivery. At least one of the other defects was certainly not minor. The Act refers to 'freedom from minor defects'. This vehicle was not free from minor defects; nor were all the defects minor. For the reasons which I have discussed above and for the reasons advanced by counsel for the pursuer, I am of the opinion that the sheriff misdirected herself and that the matter is at large for this court.\n This court is required to put itself in the position of a reasonable person and ask itself whether, in the state in which it was shown to be when it was delivered, this Range Rover was of satisfactory quality for such a vehicle. I believe that a hypothetical jury would answer that question in the negative. So would I. This was a very expensive car, sold as a high quality vehicle. It was delivered with a differential which required to be replaced and which was later replaced by Shields when they re-acquired the vehicle. It had the other defects referred to above. An objective purchaser of such a vehicle would not, in my opinion, have expected to have a vehicle with these defects delivered to him in implement of the agreement which he had entered into. The sheriff found that the pursuer had validly rejected the vehicle and that his rejection was not invalidated as a result of his having continued to drive the vehicle and pay the instalments. If I am right so far, the pursuer was entitled to reject the vehicle for most of the reasons which he gave. I do not feel able to conclude that he was entitled to reject the vehicle because of the position of the pedals for the reasons which I have given. Nor would I have reached that conclusion in relation to either of the defects of which he was aware. ...\".\n Looking at these reasons given by the sheriff principal for his decision to recall the interlocutor of the sheriff, it is plain to us that what the sheriff principal was considering was whether, in the sheriff's decision, which was undoubtedly a decision on a question of mixed fact and law, involving the application of sections 10 and12 of the 1973 Act to the primary facts, an error of law could be discerned. He concluded that it could and that it was evident that the sheriff had misdirected herself in law in reaching the conclusion which she did.\n During the course of the debate before us, some reliance appeared to be placed by the appellants on the decisions in Thomas v Thomas and Thomson v Kvaerner Govan Ltd. In our view, the well-known dicta in these cases, concerning the limitations imposed upon an appellate court when reviewing a decision on fact of a judge of first instance, have no direct bearing upon the issues in this case. What the sheriff principal did was to examine critically the sheriff's decision on a question of mixed fact and law and to conclude that the sheriff had misdirected herself in law. He did not interfere with the sheriff's findings of primary fact. In our opinion, nothing said in those cases constitutes an obstacle to his reaching such a decision.\n\"it was common ground that the outcome of this case depended on whether, when the hire purchase agreement was entered into, the Range Rover was of 'satisfactory quality' in terms of the Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act 1973 as amended.\"\n(1) Except as provided by this section and section 11 below and subject to the provisions of any other enactment, ... there is no implied term as to the quality or fitness for any particular purpose of goods bailed or (in Scotland) hired under a hire-purchase agreement.\n(2) Where the creditor bails or hires goods under a hire-purchase agreement in the course of a business, there is an implied term that the goods supplied under the agreement are of satisfactory quality.\n(b) where that person examines the goods before the agreement is made, which that examination ought to reveal ...\".\n(b) if the breach is material, to reject any goods delivered under the agreement and treat it as repudiated.\n(a) as to the quality of the goods or their fitness for a purpose, ... shall be deemed to be a material breach.\n(3) In subsection (2) above 'consumer contract' has the same meaning as in section 25(1) of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977; and for the purposes of that subsection the onus of proving that a hire-purchase agreement is not to be regarded as a consumer contract shall lie on the creditor. ...\".\n It was acknowledged by all parties to this appeal that, neither in the foregoing statutory provisions nor elsewhere, there was any recognition in law of the concept of what might be described as a remediable breach of contract. It appears to us to follow from that, and more particularly from the statutory provisions themselves, that the issue of whether the implied term created by section 10(2) of the 1973 Act has or has not been satisfied in any particular case must be capable of determination upon the delivery of the goods hired to the person hiring them. This feature of the law, in our opinion, has importance in the context of this case, for reasons which we shall explain. It was also acknowledged during the course of the debate before us that the concept of \"satisfactory quality\" utilised in section 10(2) was not to be understood as implying perfection in the goods concerned. With that view we would agree.\n A controversial issue, which figured prominently in the debate, was that of the significance of the warranty which was the subject of finding-in-fact 5 by the sheriff. The controversy related to whether the warranty was one of \"the other relevant circumstances\" referred to in section 10(2A) of the 1973 Act. The position of the appellants was that it should be so regarded, there being no reason why it should not be seen as relevant. The conclusion which we have reached is that the warranty cannot properly be seen as one of the \"relevant circumstances\". We have two reasons for reaching that conclusion. First, section 10(2A) of the 1973 Act is concerned with elaborating the meaning of the words \"satisfactory quality\", which appear in section 10(2). In section 10(2A) the concept of the hypothetical \"reasonable person\" is introduced as the origin of the standard of quality to be attained as \"satisfactory quality\". In the application of \"the standard that a reasonable person would regard as satisfactory\" there is to be taken into account \"any description of the goods, the price (if relevant) and all the other relevant circumstances\". While the words \"all the other relevant circumstances\" are potentially of wide scope, we consider that, in the context, they must be seen as referring only to circumstances actually bearing upon the quality of the goods in question. After all, sections 10(2) and (2A) are concerned with that very matter. In our view, a warranty cannot be seen as a matter bearing upon the quality of the goods supplied. In its nature, a warranty can only be seen as an undertaking by the manufacturer of the goods concerned to remedy defects in the goods which emerge and are within the scope of the warranty and that within a specified period of time. Thus the warranty must be seen as a means whereby the defects in existence at the time of delivery, or emerging thereafter within the specified period, may later be remedied by the manufacturer at no cost to the customer. The fact that such defects may be so remedied appears to us not to bear upon the issue of the quality of the goods at the time of their delivery, which is the subject matter of the implied term created by section 10(2). In its nature, a warranty is concerned with the provision of remedial action within a limited period after delivery. In short, it seems to us that, because the issue of whether the quality of the goods is satisfactory requires to be judged as at the time of delivery, the warranty can have no bearing upon that matter. The contention that the warranty may be a \"relevant circumstance\" appears to us to be tantamount to a clandestine introduction of the concept of remedial breach of contract into the legal structure of the contract. Any such concept was however eschewed by counsel for the appellants.\n\"It is however also necessary to deal with an argument based on the fact that the vehicle was sold with the benefit of a manufacturer's warranty, a fact which was relied upon to show that the buyer was required to take in his stride to a certain degree at least the type of defects which would otherwise have amounted to a breach of contract. Speaking for myself, I am far from satisfied that this argument is open to the defendants at all, having regard to the express disclaimer in the contract of sale, and also in the warranty, of any intention to vary the buyer's rights at common law, and also having regard to section 6 of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977. Nor am I convinced that this objection can satisfactorily be answered by saying that the argument founded on the warranty operates not to deprive the buyer of his common law rights but rather as a relevant circumstance for the purposes of section 14(6) operating simply to diminish the reasonable expectation of the buyer.\nMoreover, I am not clear about the logic underlying the argument. Assume that on an accurate balancing of all the relevant circumstances it could be said that the buyer of a new Range Rover could reasonably expect it to have certain qualities and that accordingly he has a contractual right to receive a vehicle possessing those qualities and to recover damages, including damages for any consequential loss, if it does not possess them. Can it really be right to say that the reasonable buyer would expect less of his new Range Rover with a warranty than without one? Surely the warranty is an addition to the buyer's rights, not a subtraction from them, and, it may be noted, only a circumscribed addition since it lasts for a limited period and does not compensate the buyer for consequential loss and inconvenience.\nIf the defendants are right, a buyer would be well advised to leave his guarantee behind in the showroom. This cannot be what the manufacturers and dealers intend or what their customers reasonably understand.\"\nA similar view was shortly stated by Sir Edward Eveleigh at page 947 where he observed: \"The fact that the plaintiff was entitled to have remedial work done under the warranty does not make it fit for its purpose at the time of delivery.\" While it is plain that the implied condition which was the subject of consideration in that case was different from that involved here, nevertheless, in the former legislation the expression \"all the other relevant circumstances\" was used; thus the Court of Appeal was concerned with whether a manufacturer's warranty was such a circumstance and concluded that it was not.\n\"If you have complied with all the requirements of this Agreement, we shall, if so requested by you and so far as it is reasonably practicable for us to do so, transfer to you the benefit of any warranty given by the manufacturer or supplier of the vehicle which is capable of transfer by us. If you make such a request, you shall indemnify us against all costs, claims, damages, expenses and liabilities incurred by us in connection with the transfer and enforcement of any such warranty.\"\n It appears to us that the foregoing clause makes it clear that, in the context of the present transaction, it could not be assumed that the benefit of the manufacturer's warranty was, in fact, ever available to the respondent. Although the warranty document was not before to the court, we proceed on the basis that it was issued by the manufacturer to the buyer of the vehicle, that is to say, the defenders. Plainly the stage was never reached in this transaction at which, under clause 6(b), the benefit of it might be contractually available to the respondent, since he never complied with \"all the requirements of this Agreement\", in the sense of performing all the hirer's obligations under it by making payment of all the instalments due.\n Further, Clause 9(i) of the agreement provided: \"Nothing in this Agreement shall in any way affect your statutory rights.\" While we did not have the benefit of detailed argument on the subject of this contractual provision, on the face of it, it is recognised as a matter of contract that the possible availability of the manufacturer's warranty to the hirer of the goods would not affect and, in particular, diminish the hirer's statutory rights.\n The appellants relied on Millars of Falkirk Ltd v Turpie, although recognising that that case had been decided under different legislation, namely the Sale of Goods Act 1893, as amended by the Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act 1973. Once again the issue before the court there was one of merchantable quality in relation to a new motor vehicle. The problem with the car was principally an oil leakage from the power steering unit, which the sheriff held to be a comparatively minor matter which could readily have been cured with very great ease at very little cost. The sheriff held that the car was of merchantable quality. There followed an appeal to the sheriff principal who adhered to the interlocutor of the sheriff. Thereafter there was an appeal to the Court of Session. The Lord President (Emslie) with whom the other judges concurred held that the sheriff had been entitled to reach the conclusion that he did, having in mind that the defect was a minor one which could readily and very easily have been cured at very small cost. He also noted that the car had been sold with a manufacturer's repair warranty, although that was not produced or examined at the proof.\n Having regard to the fact that that case was decided under different legislation and that the principal issue was whether or not the car was of merchantable quality, we do not find it of any assistance to us. Furthermore, in particular, we do not consider that it is of any assistance in relation to the issue of the relevance or otherwise of a manufacturer's warranty, since the significance of that was not the subject of any argument.\n We now turn to consider whether the sheriff principal was correct in holding that the decision of the sheriff proceeded upon the basis of a misdirection in law. In this connection, first, we note that, in paragraph 344 of her Note, the sheriff refers to section 10(2A) of the 1973 Act, as amended. However, in her reasoning we see no reference to section 10(2B) of that Act. We regard this as indicative of a failure on her part to consider the impact of that sub-section on the circumstances of this case. Since that sub-section refers to \"(b) appearance and finish\" and \"(c) freedom from minor defects\", that provision was of particular significance in the circumstances here. At a number of points in the sheriff's Note, she appears to regard minor defects and the defect in the paintwork of the vehicle as of no real significance. Her omission to take into account the provisions of section 10(2B) appear to us to amount to a misdirection in law in the circumstances of this case.\n\"It also appeared to me that counsel for the pursuer in making his submissions failed to have regard to the terms of the 1973 Act which referred to section 12A(2)(b) which entitles the person to reject any goods 'if the breach is material'. I can see no material breach.\"\nThe sheriff's reference to section 12A(2)(b) is plainly erroneous, since that provision relates to goods which are or are to be hired by description. That did not, of course, occur in this instance. However, even if the sheriff's reference is to be taken to be a reference to section 12A(2)(a), nevertheless she does not appear to appreciate the effect of that provision, the effect of which, of course, is that, where a hire purchase agreement is a consumer contract then, for the purposes of sub-section (1), which gives the right, if the breach is material to reject any goods delivered, a breach by the creditor of any term as to the quality of the goods shall be deemed to be a material breach. In paragraph 346, the sheriff does not appear to take into account the provisions of section 12A(2) at all.\n Thirdly, it is our conclusion that the sheriff has misdirected herself in relation to the relevance of the warranty, with which we have already dealt. She deals with the warranty in findings-in-fact 5 and 23. The latter finding is of particular significance, in that the sheriff stresses that any defects were easy to rectify and would be covered by the Land Rover warranty. Her heavy reliance on the warranty as, in her view, a significant factor in the case can be seen from paragraphs 333, dealing with the misaligned glove box, 337, dealing with the problem in the differential, 338, which dealt with replacement of part of the transmission unit following the rejection of the vehicle by the respondent, 345 and 346. We regard paragraph 345 as of particular significance in this respect, where the sheriff observes: \"I also consider that a particularly relevant circumstance was that there was a three year warranty for the vehicle.\" It appears to us that this particular error underlies the whole basis of the sheriff's decision.\n\"The pursuer acted totally unreasonably in refusing to accept Shields' offers to remedy any alleged defects. He also acted in a totally unreasonable manner in refusing to accept the defenders' attempts to have matters rectified. ...\".\nIn our view, there could be no purpose in making a finding such as that unless the sheriff considered that it was a relevant component in her decision. In paragraph 345 of her Note she reverts to her assessment of the respondent as an unreasonable person.\n In our opinion, the reasonableness or unreasonableness of a party to a transaction such as this cannot be of relevance to the resolution of the legal issues which arise, although it might be relevant to an evaluation of the evidence given by such a person. Section 10(2A) of the 1973 Act provides for the application of the standard of a \"reasonable person\" to the issue of whether the quality of the goods is satisfactory or not. These statutory provisions are not concerned with the reasonableness or unreasonableness of any party to the transaction. In these circumstances we conclude that, in this respect also, the sheriff has misdirected herself.\n\"The vehicle was subject to a three year warranty from Land Rover which would enable manufacturing and mechanical defects in the vehicle to be rectified free of charge to the pursuer during that period\".\nIn that finding the sheriff says nothing about the entitlement to demand performance of the undertaking in the warranty of the manufacturer. We are prepared to assume, although we have not seen it, that the warranty was one given by the manufacturer to the person who became owner of the motor vehicle. At the material time, the owners of the vehicle were the defenders, not the respondent. Accordingly, the respondent would have had no entitlement to enforce the manufacturer's warranty. Yet it is implicit in the sheriff's reasoning that the benefit of the warranty was available to the respondent. That position flies in the face of the terms of Clause 6(b) of the contract of hire purchase quoted above. We would observe that it is perhaps not surprising that the sheriff misapprehended the contractual position relating to the warranty in this case, since the document was never before her.\n In all of these circumstances, we consider that the sheriff principal was correct in concluding that the sheriff had misdirected herself in law. What we have said regarding that goes beyond the conclusions of the sheriff principal, but the existence of any material misdirection in law rendered the case at large before the sheriff principal for his decision.\n\"An objective purchaser of such a vehicle would not, in my opinion, have expected to have a vehicle with these defects delivered to him in implement of the agreement which he had entered into.\"\nThe words said to demonstrate the application of a wrong test were the words \"objective purchaser\". We would immediately acknowledge that these words do not appear anywhere in the statutory provisions relevant to the case, which we have quoted. However, we consider that they are no more than what might be referred to as judicial shorthand for the \"reasonable person\" whose standards are enshrined in section 10(2A) of the 1973 Act. The sheriff principal's choice of language is perhaps understandable when one recognises that that provision requires that a process of consideration of the quality of the goods should be undertaken, by the standards of such a person, in the context of a transaction. In any event, consideration of other passages in the sheriff principal's judgment, which we have quoted, makes it quite clear to us that he was under no misapprehension as to the test which had to be applied. In paragraph 7 of his judgment he quoted at length the relevant statutory provisions. In paragraph 27, the sheriff principal summarises the statutory provisions, quite correctly in our view. Finally, in the opening sentences of paragraph 50 he makes it quite clear that he is applying the statutory test. In these circumstances we reject the appellants' contention in this regard.\n\"In that event can the rescinder, having rescinded for the wrong reason, perhaps because he misinterpreted the conduct of the other side, justify his action by relying on facts which come to his knowledge thereafter and with the aid of which he can prove inability? It is now well settled that a rescission or repudiation, if given for a wrong reason or for no reason at all, can be supported if there are at the time facts in existence which would have provided a good reason.\"\nWith that opinion we would respectfully agree. Thus, it seems to us that the absence of a reference in the letter of 30 March 2001 to some particular defect upon which the respondent now seeks to found possesses no particular significance, other than, perhaps, affording to the appellants the opportunity to comment on the absence of such reference in the context of any consideration of the respondent's evidence. So, in our view, the question arising is whether, on the evidence available to him, the sheriff principal was entitled to take the view he did regardless of the contents of the letter.\n\"The sheriff found that the vehicle as delivered had a number of defects. These are referred to in findings of fact 6 (scratch on the lid of the ashtray and missing navigation disk), 7 (vibration due to a fault in the balancing of the wheels and steering pull), 9 (ashtray lid and pedal positioning), 10 and 11 (pedal positioning), 18 (glove box misaligned; part of the paintwork on the roof poorly finished), 19 (road speed related noise from the transmission/drive system resulting in the later replacement of the front differential), 20 and 21 (incorrect wheel balancing causing excessive wear on the tyres). The sheriff commented more fully on these defects in paragraph 332 to 343 of her Note.\"\n\"Considering these defects in isolation, in my opinion the sheriff was entitled largely to discount them when determining whether the vehicle was of satisfactory quality. However, the presence of these defects, along with others which were more serious, could be indicative of a vehicle which was not of satisfactory quality.\"\n As regards the vibration caused by incorrect balancing of the wheels and steering pull, the sheriff principal, in paragraphs 36 and 37 acknowledges that the sheriff had expressly found that the steering alignment had been properly set on rectification by the appellants. The wheels had been rebalanced in March 2001, which at least for a period of time cured the problem of vibration.\n\"There was a road speed related noise emanating from the transmission/drive system. This was caused by a fault in the front differential unit. This was never noticed or rectified by Shields prior to the pursuer rejecting the vehicle. In the summer of 2003, Shields purchased the vehicle and replaced the front differential unit in under two hours. ...\"\nThe sheriff principal goes on to say that the sheriff recorded in her Note that the respondent complained about the fault in the differential from an early stage. The witnesses who had prepared reports on the vehicle all found it to be a fault. She did not understand why Shields had failed to rectify it before the pursuer sent his letter of rejection, nor could she understand why the pursuer put up with the fault for so long.\n As regards the misalignment of the glove box, the sheriff principal records, in paragraph 40, that the sheriff accepted that it had been agreed that this was a defect, although the respondent had not complained about it at the outset, or in his letter of 30 March 2001. Similarly, he records that the sheriff found that part of the paintwork on the roof of the vehicle was poorly finished (finding-in-fact 18). The sheriff had dismissed this defect in paragraph 336 of her Note as \"a small defect and not material in considering the durability of the vehicle\".\n\"There were several defects in this vehicle at the time of delivery, only some of which were minor. The pursuer was aware of two of these at the time of delivery. At least one of the other defects was certainly not minor. The Act refers to 'freedom from minor defects'. This vehicle was not free from minor defects; nor were all the defects minor.\"\n\"This court is required to put itself in the position of a reasonable person and ask itself whether, in the state in which it was shown to be when it was delivered, this Range Rover was of satisfactory quality for such a vehicle. I believe that a hypothetical jury would answer that question in the negative. So would I. This was a very expensive car, sold as a high quality vehicle. It was delivered with a differential which required to be replaced and which was later replaced by Shields when they reacquired the vehicle. It had the other defects referred to above. An objective purchaser of such a vehicle would not, in my opinion, have expected to have a vehicle with these defects delivered to him in implement of the agreement which he had entered into.\"\nIn these circumstances the sheriff principal concluded that the pursuer had been entitled to reject the vehicle. As we see it, the sheriff principal's conclusion was based upon findings of fact as to the state of the vehicle made by the sheriff. Having considered the basis of the sheriff principal's reasoning, we are of the opinion that he was quite entitled to reach the conclusion that he did. We are therefore not persuaded that we should interfere with his judgment. Accordingly, in all the circumstances, we shall adhere to the interlocutor of the sheriff principal and refuse the appeal."}
{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "The plaintiffs brought an action of ejectment for 350 arpens of land situated near St. Louis. Their title was founded on a concession by Delassus, Lieutenant Governor, to Mordecai Bell, 29 January, 1800.

A survey of the entry was made in March, 1818, and a patent to Peltier was issued 16 July, 1832. Possession has been held under this title since 1819. The title was conveyed to the defendant.\nOn 29 May, 1818, an entry was made, which authorized the survey of Coontz, but no patent has been issued on it.\nThe township in which the above tract is situated was surveyed in 1817, 1818, and 1819, and was examined in 1822. Since 1804, a certain mound on the land has been called Stoddard's mound.

That the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover the land embraced in Peltier's patent.\n2. That they were not entitled to recover the land embraced in Coontz's survey.\nThe decision of this controversy mainly depends on the construction of certain acts of Congress. By the Act of 2 March, 1805, all persons residing in the Territory of Orleans, who had claims to land under the French or Spanish government, were required to file their claims for record with the register of the land office or recorder of land titles, and provision was made for confirming them.\n\"provided, however, that till after the decision of Congress thereon, no tract of land shall be offered for sale, the claim to which has been in due time, and according to law, presented to the recorder of land titles in the district of Louisiana, and filed in his office, for the purpose of being investigated by the commissioners appointed for ascertaining the rights of persons claiming land in the Territory of Louisiana.\"\nThe same reservation was repeated in the Act of 3 March, 1811.\nin Missouri, issued before 10 March, 1804, to file their petition in the District Court of the United States for the confirmation of their claims. And every claimant was declared by the same act to be barred, who did not file his petition in two years.\"\n\"state in the first class what claims, in their opinion, would in fact have been confirmed, according to the laws, usages, and customs of the Spanish government and the practice of the Spanish authorities under them. And secondly, what claims in their opinion are destitute of merit, law, or equity.\"\n\"That from and after the final report of the recorder and commissioners, the lands contained in the second class shall be subject to sale as other public lands, and the lands contained in the first class shall continue to be reserved from sale as heretofore, until the decision of Congress shall be against the claims of any of them, and the lands so decided against shall be in like manner subject to sale as other public lands.\"\nThese are the facts and statutory provisions which are material in the case. The defendant, under the entry and survey of Peltier, holds the elder legal title to the land in controversy, except the one acre and sixty-three hundredths, which is covered by the entry and survey of Coontz. Until the confirmation of the plaintiff's title by the act of 1836, the legal title to the land claimed was not vested in the plaintiffs.\nObjections are made to the intermediate conveyances under which the plaintiffs claim. And first it is insisted that the deed from Bell to Mackay was not proved. It is stated on the record, that there was no proof that R. Caulk, the syndic, before whom the deed was signed and acknowledged, had authority to act as such.\nare not before the Court. But if the execution of the instrument were now open to objections, they could not be sustained. Forty years have elapsed since this deed purports to have been executed. From that time to this, a claim under it seems to have been asserted. It was presented to the commissioners in 1811, having been filed with the recorder of land titles, in 1808. And again, it was brought before the commissioners in 1835, it having remained on file until that time. Under these circumstances, the regular proof of the instrument might well be dispensed with. Possession, under this deed, was held by Stoddard for a time, and became so notorious that a certain elevation on the land was called Stoddard's mound.\nIndependently of the lapse of time, the unsettled state of the country at the time this instrument was signed, the transfers of the country from one sovereignty to another, the rude and defective organization of the government -- the civil and military functions being blended, are facts which no court can disregard in acting upon transfers of property between individuals. If some degree of regularity and form were observed in regard to public grants, technical and legal forms cannot be required in the transmission of claims to land, among a people, the great mass of whom were ignorant of the forms of titles, and indeed of almost everything which pertained to civil government.\nof this. On a title by estoppel, an action of ejectment may be maintained.\n\"That if it should be found that any tract confirmed, or any part thereof, had been previously located by any other person or persons, under any law of the United States, or had been surveyed or sold by the United States, that act should confer no title to such lands, in opposition to the rights acquired by such location or purchase.\"\nThis provision, it is insisted, covers the case, and defeats the title of the plaintiffs. But it must be observed that a location, to come within the section, must have been made \"under a law of the United States.\" Now an act under a law, means in conformity with it, and unless the location of the defendant shall have been made agreeably to law, or the patent were so issued, the reservation does not affect the title of the plaintiffs.\nThe holder of a New Madrid certificate had a right to locate it only on \"public lands which had been authorized to be sold.\" Peltier's location was made in 1816, and his survey in 1818. The location of Coontz was made in 1818, and his survey in 1818. At these dates there can be no question that all lands claimed under a French or Spanish title, which claim had been filed with the recorder of land titles -- as the plaintiffs' claim had been -- were reserved from sale by the acts of Congress above stated. This reservation was continued up to 26 May, 1829, when it ceased, until it was revived by the act of 9 July, 1832, and was continued until the final confirmation of the plaintiffs' title by the act of 1836. The defendant's patent was issued 16 July, 1832. So that it appears that when the defendant's claim was entered, surveyed, and patented, the land covered by it, so far as the location interferes with the plaintiffs' survey, was not \"a part of the public land authorized to be sold.\"\nthe question that he has not. His location was made on lands not liable to be thus appropriated, but expressly reserved, and this was the case when his patent was issued. Had the entry been made or the patent issued after the 26 of May, 1829, when the reservation ceased, and before it was revived by the act of 1832, the title of the defendant could not be contested. But at no other interval of time, from the location of Bell, until its confirmation in 1836, was the land claimed by him liable to be appropriated in satisfaction of a New Madrid certificate.\nReversed at the defendant's cost and a venire de novo is awarded.\nThis cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Missouri, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered and adjudged by this Court, that the judgment of the said circuit court, in this cause be, and the same is hereby reversed with costs, and that this cause be, and the same is hereby remanded to the said circuit court, with directions to award a venire facias de novo."}

Even with the high-end automation installed at the new Texas distribution center—not to mention the cash registers, wireless LANs, Internet hook-ups and back-office computers needed for each of the 38 new stores it opened last year— 99 Cents Only spent less than $5 million on IT in 2003.\nIn fact, the prospect of doing nothing but cutting corners is what prompted Adams to turn down his current job the first time it was offered to him, seven years ago, when he was director of IS at Associated Truck Parts Inc. But when the job opened up again, two years later, 99 Cents Only asked Adams to reconsider. After some hesitation, the veteran of IT at retailers The Wet Seal Inc. and J. Crew Group Inc. decided to take the risk. \"My biggest fear coming in here was that they wouldn't be willing to do a lot with technology because they would naturally be cheap,\" he says. \"I shouldn't have worried.\"\nHow does 99 Cents manage to spend so little? Like the company's founding family, Adams knows how to squeeze every dollar—make that 99 cents—until it bleeds. When he needed ten database-management system licenses, he didn't just slap down the $16,000 per seat that his usual supplier demanded. Instead, Adams surfed over to PriceGrabber.com and found the same software at another reseller for $6,000 per seat. How quickly did he get approval to switch to the cheaper company? He didn't have to seek approval. It was his decision to make. \"That's one of the beauties of working with a family-owned operation,\" Adams says. \"There's a real small power base within the company, decisions are made quickly and our whole life cycle of projects is much, much shorter.\"\nThe dollar-store industry as a whole has been slow to adopt modern systems, according to senior retail analyst Mark Mandel of the brokerage firm Blaylock & Partners LP. \"It's a fairly simple format, and the cost-benefit analysis has not pushed the players into investing in modern systems,\" Mandel says. But many chains in the industry are slowly beginning to move that way. \"All of them are trying to enhance their technology so that they can improve their profitability and ordering systems,\" says Todd Hale, senior vice president at ACNielsen Consumer Insights. \"A lot of dated material used to move through this channel, so there wasn't much incentive to modernize, but now a number of manufacturers are making products specifically for this channel.\"\nMandel does note, however, that 99 Cents is not a traditional single-price retailer. Other dollar stores typically sell their wares in 4,000- to 6,000-square-foot stores, each of which grosses around $1 million a year; a typical 99 Cents Only store is about 19,000 square feet and brings in $4.8 million. And where other dollar stores target low- to moderate-income neighborhoods, 99 Cents looks for areas with a high-income demographic. \"Rich people like to save money too, and they do it in higher volumes,\" says founder David Gold. Case in point: The 18,000-square-foot 99 Cents Only store adjacent to Beverly Hills rakes in the chain's highest annual gross, averaging $10 million. And, unlike competing retailers in the dollar-store industry, the company can re-order up to 60 percent of its inventory; the remaining items in each store are one-time-only close-outs."}

He planned and executed the administration’s first state dinner for the first family, Prime Minister Singh of India, and 400 guests.\nHe mentioned that the path to being chosen to cook that dinner wasn’t an easy one. He indicated that a tasting event didn’t go as well as he had wished, and there were scheduling snags because he was in Los Angeles taping Chopped episodes, but received word he needed to be at the White House with very little notice given, and when the President comes calling, that’s kind of important.\nThese stories really humanized Chef Samuelsson and made me realize that even those who have ‘made it’ aren’t necessarily always basking in pure culinary confidence, and the road traveled can be bumpy and complex.\nMarcus has a great sense of humor, he’s kind and gracious, smiles lots, and was a natural cooking in front of the large crowd.\nHe talked about how he likes to prepare and use rum infusions in his dishes served at his restaurant, the Red Rooster Harlem, which was music to the rum-loving crowd’s ears, and Barbados is known as the birthplace of rum.\nMarcus asked the audience for questions and one new-to-television chef asked him what she should do calm her nerves before she appears on camera and he said, “Drink rum infusions,” causing the crowd to break out into explosive laughter.\nAlthough I didn’t have the opportunity to watch Chef Anne Burrell’s cooking demo, I did drop-in for the final moments as she was posing with fans and snapped a few images of her.\nShe had a long line of fans and was graciously hugging her fans, posing for pictures, and signing autographs.\nLater that night, she was also cooking at an event called Ambrosia. For that event, she made Seared Mahi-Mahi with Tangerine Compote.\nTo make the compote, combine 3/4 cup water, eight ounces of chopped tangerines, 1/2 cup orange marmalade, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 cup champagne vinegar, one 1-inch piece peeled and grated ginger, 1 bundle fresh thyme sprigs, half cinnamon stick, half red jalapeno minced, and a pinch of Kosher salt and bring to a simmer, stirring frequently and the mixture has thickened slightly, about 15 to 20 minutes.\nIt was sweet, tangy, with a touch of heat from the cinnamon, ginger, and jalepeno, and I loved it.\nAmbrosia was held at the Lion Castle Polo Estate and featured fourteen chefs and their respective restaurants. Each chef served sample-size tasting portions of one signature dish.\nThere was an open bar and the wine and locally-produced rum were flowing, courtesy of Wine World. A DJ had the music pumping and party mode was in full swing, with attendees dressed up and decked to the nines.\nI didn’t bring my big DSLR camera to this event, and I was grateful. The event was crowded, food and drinks were (spilling) everywhere, and it would have been very difficult to manage small plates of food and a big camera. Plus, even with the best camera, dark venues and strobe lights are very challenging. I happily used my iPhone camera instead.\nBarbados is known for their fish and the locals eat very little beef, and most are big fish-eaters. Athough I didn’t eat the animal-based protein in the tasting bites, there were plenty of great vegetable mashes and purees that were frequent base layers on which the fish or chicken would be layered.\nThere was an eggplant-based croquette which I loved, that had great crispness on the exterior with a soft and meat-like interior. And I savored this sweet potato mash which incorporated microgreens, diced vegetables, and a trifecta of fabulous sauces. It was so good I went back for seconds.\nThis was the Mango and Coconut Cheesecake with what tasted like a balsamic syrup or balsamic reduction drizzled on top. The cheesecake was creamy and the sauce was very intense and in case your tastebuds were sleeping, it would wake them up.\nGuava Creme Brulee – I could have made a meal out of scooping the sweet and creamy guava filling from the mini pie crusts. It was much lighter and thinner than as other creme brulee fillings I’ve had.\nSpiced Pineapple, Banana, and Vanilla Cream Cake – The little cakes were gently spiced and made from bananas and pineapple, and were floating in a sea of whipped cream.\nAmbrosia was a great time and it was the spotlight event of the festival, the Big Deal, so to speak.\nOn Sunday afternoon, I watched a cooking demonstration with Chef Paul Yellin.\nHe is an advocate of sourcing and cooking with local ingredients and teaching children where food comes from.

Then he promptly squeezed lime juice over the coconut-infused rice he made, which made me appreciate him and his style of cooking even more, as I am a no to low-salt person.\nHe poached red snapper by placing it in a gallon-sized Ziplock bag, with coconut oil and seasonings, and then dropped the bag into boiling water, where it boiled on a touch-and-go portable stovetop.

We photographed the real life sights and sounds of the real Mexico City, and I saw the real culture, food, and had the real-deal full-immersion experience. I saw the good and the bad, the beautiful and the gritty.\nOver the years I’ve been to many local food festivals. A few I’ve blogged about include a Greek Festival, San Diego Cityfest, Taste of Adams Avenue, and even Farmers Market visits can be a great way to experience locally-grown food and showcase great items from the region.\nI loved the Food & Wine Festival in Barbados and love food festivals in general; all the different sights and sounds, foods and flavors, are all in one place.\nThis looks like an AMAZING trip Averie. All the food, the people, the sights, the sounds, the rum… perfection. I want that spiced pineapple banana vanilla cream cake!!!! I’ve never been to a food festival before but I’ve been to a few beer festivals before! I kinda love beer. Just the girly, fruity kind!! I’m not afraid to admit it! I want to go to Barbados now!\nThat is the one thing we differ on – I am NOT a beer girl. Just means more for you! But you would have LOVED this festival, Sally! So many great things to eat, see, do – it was a blast!\nWow, looks like an amazing event – so much food and fun! Great pics too!\nI love chef Marcus…and Top Chef so addicted to that show…never been to Barbados…but seeing your pictures view from your room makes me put it on my next travel to place…wow…and wow too the food and drinks look amazing!\nI love Top Chef, too! And the new Life After Top Chef – love em all!\nSo cool! I’ve never been to Barbados, but I really want to go there one day.\nGreat photos Averie and a good piece all together. Nice event."}

Helsinki: UNU-WIDER.\nChild malnutrition continues to be a serious impediment to development both at the individual and national levels in many developing countries. In Mozambique, despite a high and sustained GDP growth, child malnutrition has been decreasing at a rather slow pace over the past 15 years.\nIn this study, using the Mozambican Demographic and Health Surveys 2003 and 2011 we find that household wealth, mother’s education, area of residence, and access to safe water and improved sanitation facilities have a strong relation with different measures of chronic child malnutrition.\nAlso, the relative importance of these variables remained mostly unchanged over time.\nWe conclude that continued and more focused and effective interventions aimed at directly reducing child malnutrition should be undertaken by all public and private actors involved."}

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "Which Writer Will Make It? The Writers’ Litmus Test.\nThe last week – for me – has to have been one of the best so far. I was tremendously excited when Children of The Plantation reached 209 on Amazon.com best sellers list and for twenty-four hours it was in the number one position in ‘movers and shakers’. To have reached those ‘heady heights’ resulted in some tremendous sales on Amazon.com and I must thank each and every one of you who bought a copy of the eBook. The Assassins’ Village did very well too. Thank you!\nStrangely enough though, sales were not so strong on Amazon.co.uk. Although sales have been pleasing they are nowhere near as buoyant as on Amazon.com. Perhaps the economy is scraping along rock bottom, or the UK market is not so aware of eBooks, I’m not sure. Even so with Children of The Plantation at only £1.14 (99c) I would have thought most people could afford it. I sense a mystery here that needs looking into!\nI’ve been a published author since, ‘The Crossing’, my first novel, was published in 2009. Since then and more recently I’ve met and corresponded with dozens of unpublished writers. Each writer has their own hope and dream about writing, and I’ve spent many an hour commiserating over tales of rejection, sparse sales, sharing good news, and hearing more plots than MI6, FBI or Mossad ever have.\nListening to all these hopefuls, I’ve discovered something significant. I couldn’t in a thousand years tell you who will eventually succeed. But I can tell you in about five minutes which writers are certain to fail.\nThe guaranteed failures carry their amateur attitudes and beliefs like a second skin or bad perfume. There is an ever pervading cloud of Eau de Tragedy emanating from their bodies and wafting into the noses of readers, publishers and editors who might otherwise be interested in the writer’s work.\nIf you even suspect you’re wearing this scent, you need to lose it, now. And you can do this by taking The Writers’ Litmus test.\nHow often do you hear the word ‘but’?\nAagh! At this point, I want to bang their head against a wall. I don’t necessarily think that my advice will turn this writer into an overnight success, or get their manuscript looked at. Neither is it because so far they are ignoring me. The problem with these ‘But people’… is that they have already decided that they know everything they need to know about writing. They may be talking to me with any manner of idea, possibly hoping to network, or because they think their work is brilliant and they want me to agree. This will not get them published, be it traditional or eBook publishing.\n‘But’ is probably the worst excuse you can make for your writing while hoping to succeed.\nThere’s no point in saying, ‘But I want my book published by…la di da’, when you know it isn’t possible as that publisher doesn’t publish that genre. Or if your manuscript is returned because your plot is hackneyed and your characters are thin, “But I planned it to be that way . . .” is not the right answer. If your editor, beta or proof readers tell you that you need to give the story a real ending, “But I want to leave the reader in suspense . . .” is going to get you nowhere except a lost opportunity. Editors don’t clean up the spelling and the grammar, it’s down to you. If it’s suggested you get cracking on a second book do so…unless you’re a celebrity, one book will not make your fortune.\nRemember, no one has to buy your book; there are many more thousands out there. If it isn’t selling anywhere, write something different.\nYou cannot make excuses for your writing and hope to succeed. Don’t think you know all the answers, that you’ve done all your homework. The best thing is to listen to the information being given. Real life is not school, where you have a test and you receive an ‘A’ for knowing the answers. Remember, if you assume that the words flowing from your fingertips were dictated to you by God, only you and God are ever going to get to read them.\nAnd remember also, no perfume – not even Eau de Tragedy – sticks forever if you wash it off. Don’t make those excuses, listen to those who have succeeded and take their advice. If you are told to revise, do so, you can leave your tragic past and failures behind. I truly hope this article doesn’t sound patronising in any way, as I am passionate in what I believe in. There are some fantastic people out there who are extremely experienced and a lot of their advice is free.\nYou can sell your work –so go out and do it! What do you think?\nThank you for reading this latest blog post and thank you for taking the trouble to buy and read my books – I’m not the best writer in the World, not the most successful, but I am listening to you out there and learning from what you tell me. Have a great week everyone.\nGreat blog, Faith and so very true!\nLove your article, love the 'but'. At the Business School we had a saying that if people replaced 'yes, but' with 'yes, and' they'd be on the first rung of success.\nOh, I clicked something and it all went pear-shaped. Anyway, if the first bit arrived for moderation, please marry it with the rest.\nYou're right when you say that people should and can learn to write better and that listening is a good way of moving forward. I also agree that what we write isn't dictated by any kind of God. OTOH, what we write and how we write is what we are and who we are. My advice would be that every writer should try and share the readership of the authors they most admire. Once they've managed to reach that audience and managed to elicit a response from them (a monumental task), then they should follow your advice to the letter. And, as you say so brilliantly, change the aftershave.\nI do not consider myself a writer. I have only written one technical book so I will safely classify myself as a reader. Lately my focus has been using twitter to search for interesting well written books. I download some recommended ebooks and give them a go. What I am finding is that there are many mediocre books written by less than brilliant authors. I want to give indie authors a chance as the big publishing companies are not. I do know there are some gems to be found so it is worth it. What makes it difficult is the bias reviews and 5 star ratings for boring books. The best ones are lost in the crowd. It is great to read some honest reviews and those are the sites I will return to often. Thank you.\nGood day, Faith! I think there is a lot to be said for writing another novel. Many of them, in fact, and not just for financial reasons. You learn a lot from your first novel. You don't realise how much, maybe, until you've written the next one and the one after that. Writing a novel is never easy. But eventually you begin to feel that you know what you are doing. It's at that point that you can ignore other people's advice and write the novel that expresses the real you. Those are the novels most worth reading. Sometimes people achieve it with their first one. There are some very gifted writers out there and every one is different."}

Whether it is for kids or adults, we have some precautions you can take to ensure your pool is not a hazard in any way.\nIf you have kids in the house or neighbor children who often play in your backyard, one of the first steps would be to install a fence around the pool. This will keep kids from falling into the pool when there is no supervision. When choosing a fence to install, make sure it is self-latching and closing. This ensures that the gate will remain latched even if you forget to close it. You have no idea how many lives a step as small as installing a fence has saved.\nFor those that have an above-ground pool, a fence obviously would not do the trick. However, you can put a gate on the steps of the pool so kids can’t easily access it.\nSet up an alarm in the pool.\nThanks to modern technology, you can now get alarms systems that will notify you as soon as there is activity in the pool. There are various companies that make an alarm you can install in your pool that utilizes a motion sensor to detect wave movements in the water. As soon as waves are detected, you will be notified.\nIf you don’t opt for a motion detector alarm, you can install an alarm on the door of the fence. The alarm will sound as soon as the fence gate is open, and you will realize that someone is attempting to get into the pool.\nThis should be a requirement for all adults in the house. If you have a pool at your place, then you should know how to perform CPR. There are numerous different organization that teach CPR, like the American Red Cross, so learning it isn’t a hassle.\nDon’t install a diving board.\nDiving boards are nothing but trouble. They tend to be a hazard and result in pool-related injuries, so you are better off not installing one. This way kids and adults alike won’t try to perform dangerous dives or slip off it.\nStore a first aid kit along with rescue equipment near the pool.\nYou should have at least two lifesavers or a life hook near your pool. These can save lives, so they are important to keep within arm’s reach. A first kit is also important just in case someone gets injured. Keep everything nearby so you can easily treat little injuries.\nWhile there are measures you can take on your own, it is always helpful to have a professional come in and inspect your pool for safety. For Caloundra residents specifically, its can have done by regular pool safety inspections in Caloundra. A professional comes and ensures your pool is up to safety standards from every aspect so you can know that you’re doing everything possible to avoid accidents."}

Some 5-8 years before menopause women experience certain changes in the patterns of menstruation. And this stage in women’s life can be termed as perimenopause. This is the stage where ovarian function begins to slow down and the eggs fall short. There is decrease in levels of the hormones estrogen and progesterone. And due to fall in these hormones there might be premenstrual spotting.\nHowever, if premenstrual spotting takes place in young females who have not yet entered the stage of perimenopause/menopause then it would be vital to talk to the doctor. This is because; one of the symptoms of endometriosis is premenstrual bleeding. Some women do not know that they have premenstrual syndrome. But premenstrual spotting might be due to this syndrome.

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "As our website already indicates, ITO heavy equipment has a strong emphasis on tracked dumpers. In view of the fact that other machinery traders barely have any tracked dumper in stock, the question may arise why we specialize in tracked dumpers? From conviction. Tracked dumpers are extremely versatile as to their field of use.\nWhile 10 years ago, these dumpers were mostly used for their initial intention, i.e. moving excavation on difficult soil, nowadays more and more branches have discovered the advantages of the caterpillar drive. May it be for corn harvest, machine-driven cleaning of solar plants or for mowing – a tracked dumper can be customized with ease and its undercarriage can carry any installation you can think of.\nYet it preserves the advantages any tracked dumper offers: climbing steep inclines (up to 35°), minimal floor loading (around 0,2 kg / cm²), driving on almost impassble paths and enormous payload of up to 20 tons.\nThe all-terrain vehicles are mainly produced in Japan. Namely by Morooka that solely manufacture tracked verhicles, Komatsu from Osaka, Yanmar, IHI and Yanmar. Most of the mentioned tracked dumper manufacturers have cut back the production focusing on mass products. Solely Morooka has maintained its focus making it a household name when tracked dumpers are referenced.\nEquipped with steels tracks – most come with rubber tracks -, tracked dumpers don't suffer too much damage on the tracks. This results in enormously reduced maintenance costs since rubber tracks in good quality are pretty expensive. In addition to reduced vulnerability, the steel tracks are certainly better on very hard or stony grounds.\nAs most tracked dumpers have rear tipping dump bodies, a few models by Yanmar, Komatsu and Hitachi offer 360 degree swivel skips. The benefit is obvious: while the dumper only has to drive one direction, it can still tip in any direction. This also makes the dumpers less vulnerable to damage as rotation on the tracks is one of the most common causes of damaged rubber tracks.\nHeavy equipment and construction machinery for sale and internationally shipped at best available rates. We offer the whole range of construction equipment on ITO machinery like excavators, tracked dumpers, and much more.

Keala Hagmann, a doctoral student with SEFS and the TA for the course, says they toured forest restoration projects on Bureau of Land Management and O&C Act lands in the Roseburg, Coos Bay and Medford districts; a city watershed in Ashland; private forestland in the Klamath-Siskiyou region; and former Klamath Indian Reservation forests in the Fremont-Winema National Forest. They also visited the sites of the Pole Creek (2012) and B&B (2003) fires in the Deschutes National Forest, as well as the HJ Andrews Experimental Forest within the Willamette National Forest.\nAt each stop, students met with a diverse spectrum of practitioners, stakeholders and policy makers, including silviculturists, scientists, tree sitters, a county commissioner and environmental advocates. The class got to explore dry forest restoration projects, regeneration harvests to create functional early seral habitat, a prescribed burn, wildfires and long-term ecological research sites.

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "I wanted to be more impressed. But this report falls into the trap of so many well meaning Government Commissions ... they see solutions from a politician's remove -- let us dictate by imposed policy rather than motivate by the clarity of a rigorous objective. In their 10 step recommendation regarding the educational system there is no assurance that the children are better off ... rather the focus is on different programs and things the adults need to do. Where is the central clarity of the measurable outcome?\nThe Commissioners' assessment of the implications of truly global markets and our degraded educational outcomes on the US standards of living, while somewhat superseded by Friedman (\"The World is Flat\") and others who gave us a better narrative, is no less valid and concerning.\nThe failure is in the prescription for change. An analogous failure can be seen in the Global Warming / Al Gore politician's view of achieving change -- a hugh and unwieldy cap-and-trade imposition specifically focused on carbon -- which forces all the loggerheads regarding subsidies, off-sets and minimal movement to alternate fuel sources. Thus the central reference about whether it is meaningful to the average citizen is the price of a barrel of oil versus the environmental outcome to be achieved. And another 25 years have gone by.\nHaving said this, there is little in their recommendations that I would disagree with on their face. Rather, I see a risk of the continuation of the disconnect of the policy act and a means of assuring ourselves that we are going to achieve the desired state. Most profound element of \"fuzzy thinking\" in these political fixes are the the core assumptions made. If we don't hold the focus on the outcome desired, we are led into many cul-de-sacs of well meaning recommendations. For instance, the recommendation for higher teacher pay. Probably a correct assertion, but at the present state of knowledge of what improves the classroom outcome for ALL children; it is surely not the causal fix the Commissioners assume. Our educational research has lagged so far behind achieving solutions that we really don't know what \"truly effective\" teaching (read: all our kids succeed) looks like. Therefore simply paying teachers more to attract higher quality can be a profound waste. Our Investment Banks pay top dollar -- and are we better off for it? The recommendation has as much chance of impact as paying priests more so that more of us might go to heaven.\nHere's another example: The Commission's call for universal early childhood education. This could be a powerful tool if we have clarity as what is the desired change state to be achieved; how it will be measured and how we will hold ourselves accountable for its achievement. I, unfortunately, have worked in many communities with near universal pre-school and yet still only a third of those children are ready to succeed in kindergarten and less then 2/3s of these children are able to read at a basic level by the time they reach the Third Grade.\nAs with the other recommendations, where we have already spent Billions of Dollars on activities, the core consideration must be: Universal Early Childhood Education is only valuable to the degree that it demonstrates improved outcomes for our children. And the Commission falls short of that degree of rigor for any of their recommendations. Don't our children deserve more?\nIt's an amazing post in favor of all the web viewers; they will get advantage from it I am sure.\nThis is a great tip especially to those new to the blogosphere. Simple but very accurate information? Thanks for sharing this one. A must read article!"}

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "As we talked about in previous blogs, people will go to some crazy lengths to try and get a “quick” buck. In most cases, these end up getting them in more trouble.\nSome of these staged cases can make the legitimate ones seem like cons, and unfortunately, they can put a stigma on personal injury lawsuits. With an experienced personal injury lawyer, these legitimate cases can be brought to justice, and people can get compensation for their pain and suffering.\nToday, we’re going to continue our conversation of strange personal injury cases, and how they’re not always so black and white. In this case, the plaintiff claimed to suffer from a personal injury in the least likely place, a church.\nIn August 2001, a woman named Gloria DeFrancesco in Akron, Ohio took her 94-year-old mother to go see a healing service by the TV evangelist Ernest Angley. People from all over the country flocked to Angley’s televised services at Grace Cathedral. The services were well-known for dramatically curing members of the pulpit. After the healing show, they would fall back into the ministry worker’s arms after the healings. It would make sense that there could be some injuries at these events, which was DeFrancesco’s experience.\nIt was at one of these showy services, that DeFrancesco was reportedly injured, trying to take her mother up to the stage. According to the lawsuit, six of Angley’s employees blocked DeFrancesco and her mother from going to the stage and assaulted her in the process. DeFrancesco claimed that she suffered from a detached retina, and sued the evangelist and his employees for $25,000 compensation.\nOne thing that stands out to me about this personal injury case is that all of the research I found had a different perspective of the case. There’s DeFrancesco’s perspective, in which she claimed to be roughed up by ushers while trying to get her wheelchair-bound mother to the healing stage.\nDeFrancesco’s mother was a “long-term” financial contributor to the church and was asked to go to the handicapped area to wait before going on stage to be healed. According to the lawsuit, the workers grabbed her and lifter her off the ground before striking her down. She claimed to have to go to the hospital and undergo surgery to fix her eye. She ended up suffering from facial and body trauma, as well as emotional and psychological damages.\nAccording to a local newspaper, the business manager of Angley’s church said that DeFrancesco made the allegations completely up. One witness told the police that Angley injured herself by falling face first on the parking lot pavement while walking to her car.\nThe witness went on to say that the fall was and that later she was seen hitting her head on the dashboard of her car. The spokesman of the church said that DeFrancesco schemed the entire ordeal and asked for compensation before filing for a lawsuit.\nThere were lots of holes in this case. The whole case was based on hearsay from the plaintiff and the church witness. There wasn’t sufficient testimony from medical personnel to exemplify whether the injuries were self-induced or caused from the ushers.\nIt would make sense that the witness of the church would take Angley’s side, as church-goers can sometimes get carried away by a minister’s charisma. On the other hand, we saw from the Wendy’s chili case that people DO go to some extreme measures to try and claim injury.\nIf DeFrancesco had truly been harmed by the ushers to an extent that she’d need medical attention, it would seem more logical for her to claim assault charges – then, there’s the mechanics that go into filing a personal injury lawsuit against a ministry. Just like personal injury lawsuits against businesses, there needs to be sufficient evidence that the plaintiff’s injury was the establishment’s fault.\nCan You File Against Ministries?\nIt’s not totally uncommon for people to file personal injury cases against religious ministries. In fact, a lot of these religious institutions operate like businesses, so they often carry liability insurance. Churches, just like businesses, have a legal obligation to make sure that its pulpit, employees, volunteers, and even visitors are safe while they’re on church premises.\nIf a church official hasn’t kept up with its property, then the victim has a right to receive compensation for the injuries that were suffered. Sometimes churches are also liable for unforeseeable accidents.\nIf you’ve been injured on the premises of a church, synagogue, or other areas of worship, you have a right to compensation for your suffering. The best way to receive compensation is by having sufficient evidence. Talk to an experienced attorney, like myself, get evidence from eye witnesses, take pictures and video evidence, and make sure that you document all the damages, such as medical or therapy bills.\nIf DeFrancesco had taken these measures, she might’ve won her case! Stay tuned into our blog to learn more about personal injury lawsuits and hear more about cases that have taken a turn for the weird."}

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "A good friend who is also a Camaldolese Monk, was visiting us this weekend. Like so many of us, our friend lives in a wonderful nexus of contradictions. Not only is he a monk, but he travels the world, singing and teaching about the monastic life.\nTraveling and being a monk presents odd juxtapositions for him, but he is following a simple and clear calling to not only witness his own life of monastic solitude, but to share that witnessing with the rest of us.\nHis life of contemplation makes it somewhate easier for him to explore existential questions like what his calling might be. As we were coming back from ice cream in Palmer Square, for example, he asked me what I feel the world needs from me. In other words what is my personal calling and what do I plan to do about it.\nWe talked for a bit about that, but what I found most important is the importance of the question itself. He was asking, in essence I think, why I would do whatever I plan to do. Most of our life is filled with other priorities that seem to come before why, namely of what we want to do and how.\nIt is very easy to focus on these difficult questions. What and how have many complexities and require a ton of energy and discernment of opportunities, chance and the world in general. Being a competitive swimmer, a shoe salesman or a farmer are all immenseley complex undertakings and simply managing tactics and strategies of how to accomplish any one of them is more than a full time job.\nBecause of this an immense amount of energy and cultural support are built around answering what and how. There are training programs, trade magazines and vast service industries whose sole purpose is to help facilitate tactics and strategies to achieve almost any specialized carreer, interest or pursuit.\nA significant driving force for supporting these tactics and strategies is the competitive nature of our world. The context in which we must succeed in most endeavors is a context of binary success or failure. Implicit is the fact that many are likely to pursue the same goal and in so doing guarantee that only the best will succeed, and by extension many, even most, will fail.\nThe biological reflection of this dynamic is very direct. We see both in the natural world and our cultural environment the terrific benefit of essentially sourcing the best and brightest through brutal competition. It is easy to see this both sharpens the competitors and provides a framework in which we can assign winners and losers. In nature, the criteria are simple: reproduce and survive or die. In our civilized world, we instead set objective criteria: races won, units sold, bushels harvested, etc. These simple mechanics create a dynamic of vibrancy, progress and evolution. Death and failure are necessary parts of the paradigm, the avoidance of which powerfully marshalls all possible resources, tactics and strategies.\nThe urgency created, and the complexity involved in avoiding death and failure clearly prioritize in many ways tactics and strategies over existensial contemplation. The Lion and the Antelope as well as the hawk and the rabbit are not likely involved deeply in descerning why they hunt and eat. Our cultural environment equally does not centrally encourage deep discnernment around such existensial questions. It is easy in fact to see the question \"Why?\" itself as fringe, precious and irrelevant to success or failure.\nDoes Michael Phelps, perhaps the best swimmer to ever live ask why he swims? Do the best companies in the world ask why they sell whatever they sell? Did Shakespeare ask why he wrote plays?\nThere is an ideal, obvious to my mind, where the answer is no. Just as a lion hunts because it is hungry, and hunts well because it can, I love the simple idea that successful endeavors would happen because of the simple actions in and of themselves. \"Why did I climb Mount Everest? Because I could,\" for example. Much of life has this existensial lack of teleology. A mother, a walker, a diner, a lover all act on impulses that drive and satisfy themselves without any existensial or antecedent whys.\nWhy should I not pursue my career then, simply because I am good at it, and do it well because I want to be as successful as possible? Why do I need to ask what the world needs of me? To some extent I don't think I do need to ask. To a certain degree, what I do is simply a matter of opportunity and need. The opportunity to do what is in front of me, to do the things I am allowed and prepared to do. And the need to earn money in order to live. It is basically tactical which of the things I can do: wait tables, teach philosophy or design internet programs; that I choose based on maximizing income and enjoyment.\nWhy is important, however, when others ask me to join them or when i ask others to join me. Of the many things I can do, I choose certain activities largely based on who is doing them and what they are doing. Considering the scarcity of time and the abundance of things to do, I think many of us end up selecting a small minority of the things we could do based largely on this criteria.\nWhat defines groups I think is very largely dictated by the why more than how or what.\nI really have no way of knowing whether Michael Phelps or William Shakespeare contemplated too much why they do so well at their endeavors. But the best companies definitely do ask this question and around that answer rises culture and what does or does not attract people to join them and do there what they could also do at a million other places."}

What about team sports or individual sports, does being ‘mentally tough’ as an individual carry over to a team scenario and vice versa?\nI’m lucky with the athlete group I work with, as they clearly don’t suffer with the ‘normal’ concerns of other athletes. You have to have ‘interesting’ terms of mental reference when flinging yourself off a large building or across a large canyon gap, so I’m not saying any of the Red Bull athletes are not mentally tough. Where my athletes struggle is when they become injured, dropping 30ft from the roof of a warehouse is no problem, but not being able to compete through injury really tests them. I’m often asked what makes a champion, and my answer has always been consistent – champions are not ‘made’ when they win every race, but how they come through adversity and injury. When discussing injuries last month I talked about the importance of having a positive mental attitude and a desire to get better. An athlete being reminded of their mortality through a season–stopping injury can have a devastating effect on their confidence. A series of those injuries, which are then badly managed, and it’s easy to see how a once great athlete drifts away into obscurity. As this is predominantly an issue of the mind, the athlete doesn’t talk about it or ask for help. It’s not cool to say, “hey I’m struggling here, I could do with talking to someone”. One of the attributes of mental toughness can be self denial, which is great for convincing yourself you’re going to win despite all the odds, or coming back from a career ending injury, but it’s not such a great attribute if there is actually an issue that needs addressing.\nI’m not a psychologist, psychiatrist or geneticist – I’m a fairly simple northern lad with a talent to persuade athletes to express their potential. So rather than go blind reading all the scientific studies into exactly what mental toughness is, measure it then try and improve it, it’s much easier to draw on personal experience and anecdotal observations from the athletes. There are without doubt more mentally resilient athletes than others, I’ve seen this and still see it. In the back of your mind you think, “I’m glad ‘x’ athlete is in that position because ‘y’ athlete would not be coping well right now”. As a coach it’s up to me to recognise what strengths each athlete has, which situations and environments they thrive in and try and ensure that they spend as much time in those situations and environments. Managing personalities and characters is a key function of any coach, and it’s not something you can do a course in. If you can’t manage those personalities you won’t get the best out of your athletes.\nSo how do I work on mental toughness with the athletes, and what is there for the weekend warrior to learn from it? As mentioned, there are several scientific studies, and even recognised questionnaires to measure how mentally tough you are. However, as I see it, something like mental toughness needs to be incorporated into everything an athlete does in a training situation every day, through ownership and responsibility. It’s not for me to sit down with an athlete like a pseudo psychologist, my domain is in the training environment. This is why I rarely tell an athlete what to do in training, despite what you may think or think you’ve seen me do – I don’t actually tell the athletes what to do. I give them a set of options to choose from (which range from hard to horrific, maybe all just horrific actually) and it’s the athlete’s choice which of the horrific sessions they do. Equally the session itself will also have decisions to be made in terms of order of exercise, so the athlete has total ownership of the pain they have brought on themselves. It’s also good to introduce an element of competition whether that’s against others or themselves, but again it’s all self selected (inflicted) so they are choosing to put themselves in that position. This means that training becomes one enormous series of mind games that the athlete brings on themselves. Athletes are all too often told what to do and when to do it, yet when it comes to self motivation and making decisions for themselves this is left to the most crucial time imaginable – when they have to perform in competition.\nGetting them used to making decisions which put themselves in various states of extreme unpleasantness, combined with their natural competitive instincts all helps to train ‘mental toughness’ as you go, rather than sitting down and saying “OK, this is a mental toughness session”. You get the best of both worlds in both of effort put into the training session and helping them ‘toughen up’.\nI’m not saying this is a substitute for bespoke help from a trained professional in coaching the mind. I’ve worked with many specialists who can help an athlete ‘figure themselves out’. Just as we want an athlete to know their own body it is equally important for them to know their own mind. Talent soon runs out at the top end and it soon becomes about hard work and attention to detail, it’s one of the reasons you see amazing junior athletes not transfer that success at senior level. Winning isn’t coming as easy as it used to and confidence soon slips.\nWhether you’re an elite or weekend warrior you can employ these tactics into everything you do. Training session roulette is where you write down different training sessions, each more horrendous than the previous one, then draw out of a bowl or hat. 1000 Apologies is a training session some of the athletes have come to know well. You choose ten exercises, then have to do 100 reps of each exercise. However the order of those exercises and how many reps you do is up to you. This means you start playing a huge mind game with yourself thinking, “I’ll get all the dead lifts out of the way first and save the air squats till last”. You need to keep a running total of what you’ve done, and as you can imagine it doesn’t matter which way you try and skin this cat it turns into a nightmare of pain. When out on a XC with friends or on your own, set challenges on the way – if you don’t make it up an ascent in a certain amount of time you have to do it again. These are just some examples of what you could do, the limit to any of this is your imagination and something we call the mirror test. If you were on that XC ride, and you didn’t make the ascent in the time you set yourself and should go back down and do it again, will you ‘pass’ the mirror test by actually doing it? Or decide to lie to yourself and press on?\nIt shouldn’t all be about ‘stick’ though, there has to be some ‘carrot’. You should throw treats into these sessions as well, so it’s fair and balanced. The bigger the treat you put into the mix, the larger the ‘stick’ has to be though to balance the game out! You can have some real fun with this, especially with a training group.\nIf you can consistently pass the mirror test, then when you do become injured or find yourself at the top of a race run, you’re simply in a mental space you’re used to putting yourself in. Because you’ve consistently chosen to be in this place through training, you can cope and can see a way out of it – through knowing you can get yourself through it. Self reliance, self motivation and supreme confidence in your own ability through ownership, responsibility and accountability. Whether you’re a racer fighting for a World Championship or out shredding with mates, we could all use those attributes couldn’t we?"}

It is not possible to remove the wrinkles 100%, but they can be significantly reduced. In the following article, we will show you how to make homemade facial mask against crow’s feet.\nBlueberries are an excellent antioxidant, nourish the skin, treat acne, hydrate and balance the oily skin, but also remove fine lines and wrinkles. Namely, blueberries are fighting against free radicals that attack the skin. Therefore, they are the perfect ingredient for reducing your eye wrinkles.\nMix the blueberries in the blender. Next, in a bowl add the yogurt, honey, lemon juice and the barley flakes. Mix these ingredients until they combine nicely. Afterward, add the blueberries in the bowl with rest of the ingredients, and stir well. Store the blueberry mask in the fridge for 5 days max.\nWith a cotton pad apply the blueberry mask around the eyes or any affected skin area. Let it sit for 15 minutes, then rinse it with lukewarm water and apply a moisturizer. This face mask can be applied every night.

I’ve been very much enjoying the feeling of ‘space’ the new year has brought with it … space to think, dream and be. Breathing space. Do you feel it too?\nWith one turn of the calendar, all the rush and hurry at the close of one year is left far behind, replaced by a magical sense of possibility. Apart from it signalling the start of the tennis season, the thing I most like about January is that time slows, creating more opportunities to appreciate the little happenings. With that idea in mind, I thought I’d share a few of my recent moments.\n… There’s been flower gazing and cookie baking.\n… Lots of bright sunny days, green grass and one very happy dog … Oh, and there’s always an opportunity to take my favourite sandals out for a relaxing wander.\nBut I suppose the most exciting thing about this year for me is that I’m writing again. Actual honest-to-goodness proper writing … and gosh, it feels so fantastic! I’ve pushed all the doubts, negativity and annoying self-criticism to one side (for the moment at least), and I’m trying to just let the words do what they do best.\nso happy to hear you are getting into your writing! and i love your sandals, have had those exact yellow ones on my list for a while now, just need to figure out how to order them so they fit!\nYellow sandals. What a wonderful beginning to the year. And yes, we too are revelling in summer – especially in tennis-on-TV. I got sick of not being able to read the tennis score in the bottom left-hand corner of our old analogue TV, and went out and bought a U-beaut 40in digital Samsung (with savvy daughter’s advice, of course). We’ve hardly had it off the tennis channel since getting it home and setting it up! And think: in only 10 monthly instalments of my Carer’s Allowance, I can have paid for it! Something screwy in my priorities, perhaps? Now if only I could help my (aphasic) husband to remember how his much-loved tennis is scored. I’ve got a card on his tray-table with an explanation of the tennis scoring boxes all explained, but his addled brain just won’t deal with it. Never mind. He loves the action anyway. What’s not to be thankful for!\nWonderful! I love your photos (especially the one of Baxter) and I love to hear the news that you’re writing again, and enjoying it!\nHi Teresa – Happy to hear you’ve arrived in Hong Kong!!\nYes thank goodness the writing is happening … it’s taken me long enough to get organised.\nOh, well done on the writing – congrats! I’m on holidays before I start my new day job in real estate, so I’m trying to really soak it all in because I know I won’t be getting anymore hols for quite a while! I love the tennis, and the cricket, and the cycling! Went to the Australian Road Cycling National Champs last weekend (which happened to be held in my very own city of Ballarat), and had a ball. I love this time of year.\nI haven’t had much to eat today….. and those biscuits look absolutely and utterly stunning. I think I have some cubes of cheese and about 3 carrots in the fridge. Blah.\nI do hope you’re enjoying your holidays still … though I’m sure you’re also pretty excited to soon start your new adventure in real estate! … The tennis and cycling are pretty much the only two sports I’ll indulge in … though a few others can hook me in from time to time. How fantastic that you went to the Road Cycling National Championship – that would have been fantastic!!\nwhat lovely toes you have, tracey!\nhappy new year to you too, you enjoy the season now!\nlittle moments are important. i’m enjoying mine too. and so glad you are writing.\nthat’s right, you just go on writing.\njust don’t think too much about it, and do it.\nand enjoy it, above all.\nI’m glad you are having some quiet time, and I envy you a lot! I don’t feel the same. Actually the opposite, but not in a negative way…it’s a creative rush that I’m having. I must work extra hours (extra extra hours) to get very little money, it’s a very difficult time, but I’m happier than what I used to be. I feel like it’s worth it. Right now I can’t even pay the bills, but I know I will, and it’s worth it.\nHi Bobbi – Being in the midst of a creative rush is wonderful … but yes, it can take a toll when it sees you working harder than ever. But when such work brings great happiness, it’s worth it in the end (I agree with you there).\nOh, this post made me wish for slow and quiet times. I feel like january is rushing by. The sun is always shinning over here, but I have so little time to enjoy my afternoons. Oh, well… maybe in february everything changes (we have Carnaval, so I guess everything will eventually stop anyway).\nLove, love, love your yellow sandals! And I’m so glad you’re writing again, way to go Tracey!\nHi Camila – Well I do very much hope that January has put its brakes on at least a little for you … that feeling of time rushing by is never good. If not, I’m sure you are right in saying that February will have things moving a bit slower … it would be wonderful for you to have a bit more time to just ‘be’ for a while.\nSo far, mostly moments of uncertainty for me. But uncertain moments have quite a lot of potential to be momentous. Cheers to your writing!\nYour sandals are TOO cute! And make me long to wear a pair! Glad to hear you’re enjoying the new year!\nBaxter loves a good roll in the backyard … especially when the sun is nice and hot (though he probably likes inside time just as much).\nI hope things aren’t getting too busy in your world yet … there’s plenty of time for that later on.\nLove the photos, especially the happy dog and the cookies.\nHappy yellow sandals – I love them 🙂 January is a slow time of year – so many people still on holidays – great time to catch up on reading and relaxing. Good to hear you are writing.\nJanuary is perfect for taking things slower – I’ve been catching up on some long overdue reading … and of course, being off work, I’m now finding it easier to relax.\nI’ve missed your blog posts.\nWonderful photo of a flower! Jealous, I’m utterly awful at taking photos of flowers. Good to read you are writing again and I hope you have a grand 2012.\nHello Tracey – January in these parts has most assuredly declared itself a breath of fresh air in more ways than one! Oh yes, Janvier has bolted like a horse intensely anticipating the opening of its gate, before one ardent long-race.\nThe Year of the Dragon waits ever so quietly for me to chime in, as my year has finally cometh! Surely this will be all the momentousness I’ll need for the yearlong.\nHi Lisa – That breath of fresh air at the start of each new year is most welcome … let’s hope it blows us both in the right direction. I very much like your description of January as an impatiently waiting horse – that’s very much how I feel … there is so much ahead, that I just can’t wait to begin. I just need to remember to focus!\noh tracey, this post made me so happy to read. I’ve been flower gazing and cookie baking too, but more as relief from last-minute editing.\np.s. I love your sandals, where are they from?\nI’m really glad to hear you’re writing again and feeling so good about it. Flower gazing and cookie baking are two of my favourite pastimes. Hope you have a wonderful 2012!!\nHi Selma – Thanks … I feel like it’s been a long time since I felt so good about writing. For some reason or another I think I was self-sabotaging my efforts. I honestly don’t understand why I work so hard to resist it.\ni am another fan of your sandals."}

Since June 2008, all work on the estate has been carried out in accordance with organic production criteria. Wines from the 2012 vintage will be certified as organic.

The travel ban follows months of controversy fueled by media-generated rhetoric as a \"ban on Muslims\" gaining the attention and attacks of CAIR, Democrats, and injunctions were applied by lower court rulings in appeals earlier this year. The ban, known as the \"Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States\" was signed by President Trump. The executive order was signed as part of an extreme vetting process to provide further scrutiny to refugees and travelers from the countries stated. President Trump stated \"We don't want them here. We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas. We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country, and love deeply our people.\"\nThe ban includes a 120 day suspension of admission and directs officials to additional screening of application. The order further precludes, indefinitely, a ban on refugees from Syria. Earlier, President Trump cited that difficulty of Christian refugees from Syria to be located in the United States, but a larger influx of Muslims who had far easier times.\nToday's ruling by the Supreme Court was praised by conservatives across the nation. President Trump remarked that his number one responsibility was to keep Americans safe praising this ruling and the unanimous ruling by the Supreme Court as a way to protect the American Homeland.\nNancy Pelosi (D), House Minority Leader stated \"The Trump Administration has consistently shown that discrimination, not natural security, si the purpose of this ban\".\nThe ban does not target Muslims, as the news cycles have lauded for the past several months. The ban targets travelers that seek to immigrate or obtain a visa to the US from a few countries. The ban, with the exception of Syria, provides for additional scrutiny by the justice department. This deeper background check is in response to homeland acts of terror by refugees and visa holders. Some of these attacks were carried about by individuals that had obvious or predictable ties to terrorist organizations and likely could have been prohibited."}

In other words, you drive a car that has no armoring on it. Here is the deal, since you have never used an armored car Dubai, should you buy one now? In all fairness, you should and for a number of reasons. Firstly, the ever decreasing prices are there to motivate many. You can buy an armored car now for the price you may have not imagined. Possibility is there that your future armored car may cost you as much as a top class luxury car at best. With this in mind, is it not feasible to consider the option now? It is indeed, and you as a buyer must consider the option.\nThe problem comes when customers looking for armored cars have little to no knowledge on the subject. It is obvious that armored cars are different. The very name is different and self-explanatory. If you for some reason, still fail to know the difference, it would be strange. There are several different types of armored cars around. You must have seen some special versions in the movies. Militaries around the world have been using armored cars for ages. It is up to you to choose the armored car you want to have.\nTruth to be told, there are a number of differences between both genres of cars. Your luxury car can have enhanced armor plating but it will still be different to the one that was designed as an armored car from ground up. Several different types of armored vehicles are available in the market. There is the basic version with just enough armoring that may help the resist basic stuff, small caliber bullets and shocks. The glass is still bullet proof and will likely stand out in tests. Of course, your ordinary car will have none of these features. Other notable difference may also exist and a quick look around the car will help you know about them. From suspension to the overall level of ballistic covering, it is all different. Though you are not an expert, if you were, you would look at other differences too. Naturally, the closer inspection of your bullet proof car will continue to reveal the differences."}

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "QSR Magazine sits down with our Marketing Manager Curtis Rose to discuss what’s on the horizon for digital signage.\nQ: What challenge(s) is the digital signage industry facing right now? What do you think are the best ways to approach these challenges?\nCurtis: Even with LED emerging as the hot tech in digital signage there is no standardized mounting solution like there are for LCD. In addition, to get a truly seamless experience of an LED video wall, it’s really the mount that makes this happen. If even a single panel is misaligned, the viewing experience is compromised as the viewer’s attention is drawn to the tile defect and not the content of the message on the display.\nMaking sure you have the right mounting solution that fits the projects needs is crucial. Be sure to ask the right questions like: does your mounting partner work with all the top display manufactures? Do they have stock, custom, and semi-custom solutions? How long will it take to produce they solution needed?\nQ: How has digital signage changed/improved in recent years and where do you see it going next?\nCurtis: There have been two major changes stirring within the digital signage community: the emergence of direct-view LED technology and the increase of large-format digital signage.\nViewing Distance and Contrast – LED displays can be visible and legible from far distances (hundreds of feet), and narrow pixel pitch LED can have very high contrast at close distance.\nViewing Angle – LED displays do not suffer from the same brightness fall-off and color shift as some flat panels.\nIn addition, the pixel pitch (how close pixels are to each other) is coming down further, currently at 0.5mm, and as that drops so does price. We will see higher, but still, amazing quality pixel pitch displays become cheaper which will make them more widely available.\nAnother change we will see is that more end-users will want to have larger format video walls added to their locations. With the cost of new technology coming down end-users can afford to go big. Large format digital signage is attention-grabbing, can enhance the customer experience and create interactive environments that will lead to higher ROI on digital signage.\nPremier Mounts, and our LED division PDS, recently installed 80×18 ft video wall and we are seeing more and more of these opportunities come about. According to research, in 2018, video walls will represent 18% of all panels shipped.\nQ: What’s the new/big thing everyone is talking about in digital signage? What do restaurant leaders need to know about it?\nCurtis: Interactivity. It’s easy for a restaurant to have a touch screen for ordering, but true interactivity lies in immersing customers into the full brand experience and making it easy to find what they are looking for.\nUsing tech and touchscreens, especially for a younger generation who would rather interact with a screen than a human, is important. Making sure the order process is simple and quick, and that the touchscreen is responsive is important. These things do matter to most customers below the age of 35.\nThe most important thing is to use these methods of interactivity to also tell your brand story. Get the customer to accept your brand as part of their lifestyle, and not get just this purchase, but future purchases and the generation of word of mouth conversations that take place on social every minute. You do this by telling your brand story through interactive platforms weaving things like core values, product innovations, etc. throughout the experience.\nQ: What are the most common myths or misconceptions about digital signage?\nCurtis: In my opinion, the biggest myth is that there is little ROI in digital signage. When discussing ROI, you have to determine what you consider is a return on investment. Is it an increase in sales? Decreasing operational expenses? Increasing word of mouth marketing? ROI looks different to each business, but at the end of the day, digital signage is proven to help.\nAt times, digital signage ROI can be difficult to measure, but that doesn’t mean it is not there. For example, if you want to know if your overall sales have increased since a digital menu board install, it may be hard to eliminate other variables that could have contributed to this (like promotions, employee engagement, new processes or products).\nTaking a look at the tangible benefits like informing customers of new products, higher overall customer satisfaction, decreased operational expenses, etc can show that there is a value in having digital signage.\nQ: What are some especially innovative ways that you see quick service restaurants using digital signage?\nCurtis: As I touched on before, I think touchscreens are a major game-changer. Millennials are some of the top customers of QSR restaurants because of the lower cost of meals, the speed at which they can get them and convenient locations. Millennials have grown up with a screen in front of them and its second nature to gravitate to them rather than interact with other humans.\nWith touchscreens, they are low maintenance, don’t require an employee to take orders and if done right, can give customers more information about their purchases (i.e. nutrition facts, ingredients). This will create a more engaging buying experience and free up employees to serve customers better in ways beyond taking an order.\nQ: Soon mobile ordering apps will work with platforms like Siri and Alexa, allowing diners to order food, pay, and redeem rewards in advance. Everything will be integrated and patrons may never even interact with a human. How does digital signage play into that?\nCurtis: If this does happen in the future, and I believe it will although it won’t make up more than 30% of all orders, digital signage will still have a role for these particular customers. The key will be to understand that it will not affect current orders, but future purchases. Using digital signage to keep customers informed of new items, promotions and when it can be really powerful is storytelling.\nPart of what consumers are buying is the brand’s story and in many cases, the story is what people are buying, even in QSR. Why has Taco Bell been really successful? They are telling a hip, trendy story to millennials that they buy into it before they buy into the quality of the food. Those stories can be told using digital signage.\nQ: Please comment on the psychological aspect of digital signage.\nCurtis: Human behavior is at the core of marketing: to understand it is to understand an audience and be able to send them messaging that gets them to act in the way you desire. Digital signage is no different.\nIn a world where consumers are exposed to around 5,000 brands or advertisements each day, it’s critical to make such a lasting impact on a consumer that they then store that experience into long-term memory. Digital signage can aid in that process through visual stimulation. Studies show that information that includes images are over 60% more likely to be remembered a few days later. In addition, certain colors, shapes, fonts, etc can all play a role in making an image more memorable.\nIn the end, it’s about using the stories you tell through digital signage and their ability to resonate with a consumer.\nQ: What are you most excited about in your industry right now?\nCurtis: New technology is the most exciting thing about our industry. I get to see changes from month to month and on a year to year basis the industry can look totally different. As an example, look at the thickness of digital displays – over the past 10 years, they have gone from feet to mm. It’s incredible if you think about what digital signage in a QSR will look like in 10 years from now. We might even be implementing VR into the experience by then!"}

More than 75% of the people work from home at least once a week.\nSurprisingly, the concept of working from home is an age old one[i]. From the at-work home of creating, chopping, baking, tailoring, pottery, weaving and blacksmiths, to the 1950s multi-level marketing jobs and selling jobs – all have come back in a new format to give way to new age occupations that are not only earning money but also providing incentives to create new jobs for hiring more people.\nWorking from the comfort of home has gained prominence again owing to the culture of flexibility and the realisation that the need to balance work with everyday life is essential. For expecting or new mothers, for people with special situations where a family member requires constant care – telecommuting or remote work opportunities have been a boon.\nLet us look at various ways in which you can make money online sitting in the comfort of your home.\nFull-time telecommuting jobs – Believe it or not but there are a number of full-time corporate roles which can be done from home. Jobs in functions of accounts controller, software development, front end and backend engineers, assistants and virtual assistants, writers, operations – all have versions which can be worked out of home. Companies need to define a structure and infrastructure needs to be made available to ease the engagement.\nStartups– A number of startups and new ventures prefer to engage remote workers now. A study by WonkBlog Analysis[ii] determined, how an average worker spends 31.3 days of a year commuting to and from the workplace. This adds to the cost to the company with a real estate space and hiring graduates with high skills which would work out very expensive for a startup. The entrepreneurial culture has given rise to the alternative method of employment – by the hour or by the project. Even full-time workers with time on their hands delve into the world of freelancing to earn extra, create a distinct credibility from that of a corporate company.\nOnline Trading – This might be a difficult area to tread in for a lot of people but anyone with a keen eye and interest to study the markets can create their own methods and philosophy of trading. Forex trading and stock trading are the most common ways that people with intermediate to expert levels can look at making money. There are various guides, online blogs, video tutorials to help a person get started. However, trading is not for the faint hearted and it as the potential to lose a lot of money is real. Investing in instruments such as derivatives without studying the potential risks and analysing your own risk bearing capacity can be detrimental to your savings. Hence, one can start by using a simulated program on trading where you can create a portfolio virtually and track your own performance.\nMulti- level marketing – In simple terms this is using the power of word of mouth or networking to see a product or service. The idea is not only to sell but create a larger web of interested sellers who will create further sellers and sell more. Gone are the days of selling only Tupperware or AMWAY products. This list will give you the idea of varieties of selling and network creation one can do. Another aspect is buying in wholesale from a manufacturer and creating a website/using social media groups to promote the product or simply selling on websites like Amazon as a seller.\nBlogging /Affiliate Marketing – The reason we are grouping the two is because affiliate cannot work without a good blog. It involves engaging brands and partners who align with your core selling point of the blog. This way you can showcase them by writing unique and specific content. You link the part so your blog to their unique affiliate code received while signing up for that program and if someone purchases by clicking that link, it earns you money. Another extension is an affiliate ad network.\nConsulting – Your expertise in a specific niche could become a healthy business tomorrow. You can help people, become a mentor and actually service clients willing to pay the right price. People can charge flat fee on hourly basis or project basis. Slowly you can work your way up to a retainership which will help you increase income.\nSurveys and Reviews – You can help market research companies in gaining data on consumer insights, behaviours and preferences by filling in regular surveys by registering on various websites online. These pay anywhere from 5 pounds to 20 pounds or even more for detailed surveys. Many websites pay for writing reviews after asking you to test a product or service where you are reimbursed for the purchase.\nMystery Shopping – Similarly, one can also work as a mystery shopper to go to designated stores, restaurants and act like a regular customer while collecting detailed data on the setup, sales behaviour, decor and sales push. You would be required to prepare a detailed report and submit probably with sound recordings or photographs and send to the company for approval post which you are reimbursed and paid.\nFreelance writing – This has to be one of the most common online jobs available. From large publication houses to small websites and individuals might require content which is unique and specific. With blogging and Google Adsense with various Google algorithms in place, SEO has become commonplace. This is a new skill which can help a writer charge higher by showcasing his SEO expertise.\nTranslation – Another special skill which you can utilise is your knowledge in specific languages. You can register with one of the websites providing these services and get regular work without the headache of acquiring clients or ensuring payment. Many contractual websites – Fiverr, Upwork, Freelancer and many others enable a security factor to safeguard the freelancer payment and also ensure payment only after timely, approved delivery.\nPodcasting – You can be a YouTube star. Not necessarily a singing or dancing one but by sharing your knowledge with the world, something which people really need, in anpproachable and friendly manner will create your regular watchers who will Subscribe and Comment which will increase the traffic to your YouTube link. This will attract brands that can be associated with your niche and might pay your creating specific content or sponsor it.\nVirtual Assistance – Small and large companies require a lot of backend work to be handled. Hiring multiple administrative people might not be possible. Virtual Assistants are a boon to handle operational, clerical and repetitive tasks. Besides dedicating few hours, being with a company that will help you pick up few skills or industry insights will only help you polish your profile.\nStarting a Website – Creating a basic to medium level website is no biggie using the various applications – Wix, WordPress and many others. You can also buy the domain name and hosting. It is important to then work on tools like Google AdSense and many others that can help you create pay-per-click revenue from Google.\nTutoring – Tutoring and teaching is an evergreen profession. If you have the right subject skill set and knowledge you can assist in K-12 education to university level students in solving problems, creating assignments and teaching additional courses. There are various online websites where you can register to have surety of payment and depending upon the number of hours you can charge anywhere ranging from 10 pounds per hour to 100 pounds till university levels.\nWeb designing/Digital Marketing – With internet and Google transforming the business of business, the need of the hour for every business no matter how small, is to have an impactful online presence. If you can code or create beautiful and functional website for various sizes, it will help in generating requisite compensation easily from home as most clients would prefer talking over phone, email or video conferencing. Website maintenance will be an added revenue stream.\nWriting your own book – If you are one of those who is bursting with advice, ideas and is good at expressing them, you can look at this as one of the revenue streams. You can look at Kindle e-book as an option for self-publishing. With as little as few minutes and you can publish a book within 24-48 hours. You can look upto royalty of 70% [iii] across sales in countries like US, Canada, UK, Germany, India, France, Italy, Spain, Japan, Brazil, Mexico, Australia and few others.\nPeer-to-peer Lending – This is an old age lending transformed onto the online platform. Finding moneylending marketplace which lends to people to whom ordinary moneylending channels will not be granting loans can earn you good interest in your money. However, one should keep in mind few risks such as no direct interaction with the borrower and no credit knowledge. You have to rely completely on the word and documentation of the P2P platform. However, if you are willing to take these risks, you can earn from 10 % upwards.\nMicro-worker – These can be deemed as small research, lead marketing and various tasks which an individual or company wants to outsource. Writing reviews, commenting, finding contacts, and various such small activities can earn you while you browse. You can browse sites such as mTurk, MicroWorker, SEOClerk, ClickWorker, GigWalk to take advantage of such activities. One can also look up for such work by searching through Google – Search near me option to see the local clientele having such requirements. This will bring you more in touch with the local and regional job market.\nTeach English or various Languages – Having an English degree will help immensely to create a credibility to teach spoken and written English to non-English speaking people looking to expand their horizons. You can charge on hourly basis or course-wise depending upon the kind of client requirement. China and South East Asia countries have a good clientele ready to pay earnestly for a good English tutor. This is also useful non-English speaking students in universities having difficulties in following the curriculum due to lack of languages comprehension.\nFreelance Recruiter – This is a very commonly placed profile which can come handy to prepare you for a full-time job as well. Connecting with potential candidates, maintaining a database of people along with finding the recruiters who are willing to match the candidates’ requirements is an interesting yet daunting work. Many tools, networking websites can help you in this work and also give a head start in dealing with people and various HR issues. You will also learn about salary structuring, contract creation, negotiation and various other things. You can earn a good percentage of the profile positions’ compensation structure. The more senior positions you can fill, the higher your earning.\nWith various opportunities available and more still opening up, as companies move towards standardization, there will be no dearth of work from home opportunities in the next decade. It is smart thinking to gain skill-sets in a regular job and keep an eye on the freelance market to know your market value and the changing size of the market. It will be a good foundation to setup your own practice as an independent entrepreneur during important life events such as maternity or any unforeseen situations that might force you out of a job."}

No, it’s not a novel. It’s nonfiction. But it reads like the most beautifully written novel you’ll ever find.\nIt weaves together two stories. One is the life of Denver Moore, a sharecropper from the South caught in a life of modern day slavery during the 1960’s. Denver finally escapes, but with no education, he becomes a homeless drifter for many years to come. One of the nicest touches in this book is Denver’s authentic voice which gives the feel of his roots without overwhelming the reader.\nRon Hall is raised in the country, but quickly finds his niche in the world of dealing art and rises to fame and fortune only to lose a little bit of his soul along the way. Thank goodness for his Godly wife who pulls him back from the edge.\nPartway through the book Denver and Ron finally meet when Ron and his wife get involved in a homeless shelter. Through much divine intervention, this unlikely duet becomes the best of friends.\nThe story of redemption is beautiful and poignant. It is more than a little sad, and yet it will warm your heart and enrich your life. This one touched me on a very deep and personal level. I felt as if God was speaking directly to me about a question I’d been asking him for some time.\nDenver’s simple wisdom and prophetic insight rocked me to my core. Honestly, I don’t think I’ve ever cried over a book the way I cried over this one. I actually locked myself in the bathroom because I couldn’t stop wailing and didn’t want to upset my kids.\nThis book is about as good as they get. It combined flawless literary quality writing, an amazing message, a true heart-warming story, and I will go as far to say a huge helping of Holy Spirit anointing to top it off just right. The book will make you rethink racism, poverty, outreach, friendship, and even healing. In the end you’ll realize like Denver and Ron that everyone out there is pretty much the same kind of different as you.\nyou've made quite a good pitch for this book, Dina. I'm definitely going to keep it in mind and grab if when I get a chance. Sounds like another good gift idea.\nI just read this book last year and I loved it! Of course it was especially poignant for me in that it all happened very near where I grew up. It is an amazing story.\nHi ladies, it really is an amazing true story of redemption. As Victoria Bylin mentioned on Deb's facebook post, it would make a great book club book too.\nThis is such a wonderful book of love and redemption. Everyone should take the time to read it!\nThanks, Linda. Glad to hear you felt the same way.\nDina, this sounds like a really special book. I'll have to put it on my list for future reading.\nI think this \"same kind of different as me\" idea is part of the reason I love history so much and learning about other cultures. Though I didn't know that term for it before.\nIt really is a sad thought to think that \"we\" are so much more advanced/cultured/civilized/etc. than \"them\", because in reality it's just as the book title says.\nInteresting thought about history, Suzie. People are basically people and motivated by the same hopes, fears, and desires.\nGreat post, Dina. I haven't yet read this, but it seems everywhere I go, Christians and non-Christians are reading it in their book clubs. I'm happy it's done so well.\nIt really is top notch!"}

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "There are many different types of personal injury claims, some of which are more common than others. We’ve touched on the ins and outs of personal injury lawsuits that occur as a result of a car or bike accident as well as medical malpractice suits and even wrongful death, but what about defamation? When talking about defamation cases within the realm of personal injury law, it is important to note that they typically involve a false statement of fact that negatively affects the reputation of another individual. Even though defamation isn’t the most publicized type of personal injury claim, it is nonetheless important. One of the main differences between defamation cases and other personal injury lawsuits is that they do not occur as the result of someone else’s negligent behaviors, but instead the words of another person. If someone is spreading false statements about you and these statements have hurt your reputation or good name, you may be able to file a defamation lawsuit.\nIn large part because of the technology-centric society that we live in today, we have seen a rise in these types of cases. With the Internet and the popularity of various social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, we are constantly hearing about ‘cyber bullying’ and people using the Internet to spread hate and ill-will to others. Your reputation being harmed or ruined because of the words of another person is just as significant as suffering a personal injury that hinders your ability to live an enjoyable life. As knowledgeable personal injury lawyers, the Atkins & Markoff team wants you to know that we are here for you and are prepared to fight for your rights, and your reputation. If you have been hurt by another person’s words, you may be able to file a defamation lawsuit. In order to better understand your rights as they pertain to these types of cases, let’s go over some of the most frequently asked questions about defamation.\nIf another party intentionally or carelessly uses words that cause you emotional distress or depression, you may be able to sue that person and recover damages for the emotional harm you have suffered. Along the same lines, if someone uses words to ruin your reputation or name, you may also be able to take them to court and sue for defamation of character.\nThe bottom line: defamation is a legal definition that recognizes that words can hurt others. By law, the use of words to hurt another individual or defame them is prohibited. Before we go any further, we should make note that defamation covers both written (libel) and spoken (slander) words.\nIs it difficult to prove defamation?\nThis will depend on your particular case and on a handful of factors. In order to prove defamation, you must be able to prove that the defamatory statements were published in some way. This could be in print, radio, or some other form of media. Second, you also need to be able to prove that the statements made about you or your character are false. You cannot sue someone for saying something about you that you simply disagree with, you must be able to prove that the statements made were untrue. Lastly, you must also be able to show that you suffered personal harm, distress, or depression as a result of the false statements. This can be challenging, which is why we recommend having an experienced personal injury lawyer by your side.\nIf you think you may have a defamation lawsuit on your hands, contact an attorney from Atkins & Markoff today. We will go over your case with you and determine what your rights are, and what the next steps taken should be."}

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "My name is Therese Shechter, I’m 48, and I live and work in Brooklyn, NY.\nI’ve been a documentary filmmaker and a writer for the last ten years. I’m currently working on a film called How to Lose Your Virginity about our American obsession with virginity, and I write its companion blog The American Virgin. These days, I feel like a spend a disproportionate amount of time raising money to be able to do my work.\nThe first time I went to college, I studied art and design at the Ontario College of Art in Toronto. They didn’t give degrees back then, although they do now. When I graduated from their 4-year program I got an AOCA, which I think means Associate of the Ontario College of Art. My second time in college was in my mid-30s. I went to Columbia College in Chicago and studied Film and Video part-time while I worked at the Chicago Tribune full-time. I left after a few years because I got an internship in New York. I’ve never had a job interview where it mattered what degrees I had. It was all about the work in my portfolio or reel.\nWhen I was in high school, my best friend Rosie and I ran a weekly program at the Jewish Community Center for developmentally disabled adults called The Friendship Club. Each week we had to come up with activities for the members, who varied wildly in terms of how well they functioned on their own. The one thing everyone loved was the dances we had for all the members and staff, and our most popular had a “Love Boat” theme. What can I say? It was the 70s.\nI was working for a large Hollywood-oriented film production company as an assistant, and not only did I hate the job, I was depressed I wasn’t making my own films. After I left, with no ideas for what to do next, I got a spot volunteering at the Sundance Film Festival. I spent the next 10 days watching documentaries that changed my idea of what filmmaking could be. When I got back to New York I enrolled in my first-ever documentary workshop with filmmaker Macky Alston, who became a great mentor to me. He really helped me develop a first-person voice to tell my stories. I developed my film I Was A Teenage Feminist in that class as a purely theoretical project. He told me I had to make the film – for real not just on paper – and actually put his own video camera into my hands and told me to go forth and do some interviews. After that, I was hooked and haven’t looked back.\nIt would have to be I Was A Teenage Feminist because it’s been shown all over the world and has become such a popular Feminism 101 kind of film. I (re)discovered my own feminist identity through making the film, and it gratifies me that so many young women and men get introduced to power of feminism by watching and discussing it. I always intended it to be an accessible film that would start conversations and not shut them down, like the F Word sometimes does. I was honored to take part in Serbia’s first-ever women’s film festival last year in Belgrade. They showed I Was A Teenage Feminist to audiences that had rarely had conversations about women’s rights issues before, and the Q&A was wonderful.\nMy other film How I Learned to Speak Turkish lives in its shadow so it doesn’t get as much love. But it was a very personal film that dealt with female sexuality and its power, and helped me work through a very intense period of my life.\nThere’s not one thing that stands out, but it does help if you’re doing feminist-themed work, I guess. I’m doing this film on female sexuality, so being a woman comes with built-in credibility and my investigations come from a very personal space. Establishing trust between me and my subjects is crucial, so if I were a guy asking the questions I ask, people might have a lot more hesitation to speak to me. On the other hand, if I were a guy, I probably wouldn’t be doing the work I do.\nIn terms of hindrance, I have no concrete examples of being hindered because I was a woman. I had good role models and very supportive teachers and mentors. I think it’s a more internal struggle with putting myself out there and tooting my own horn. I was raised to be nice and be liked and not ‘show off’ too much. That’s partly from being Canadian, maybe! I sometimes ask myself what a man might do in certain situations, and the answer always comes back to me that he’d be way more self-confident and self-promoting. It’s vital to be respectful and honest in the work, but it is also the film business, and it’s brutally competitive. It’s always a conscious conversation with myself to put it out there.\nMacky Alston was a huge mentor. Also my mother and grandmother were both accomplished professional women so having that example was so important. My grandmother was a newspaper editor all her life. My mother is a professional musician, linguist and writer. It was very rare among my peer group to have a mother with an advanced degree, never mind a grandmother with a career like hers! The down side was I saw how hard my mother worked in her career(s) while still taking care of almost all the household stuff. I remember her studying for her Master’s degree at 2 in the morning, after all the other family work was done. I think that’s one reason I was wary of marriage and kids from an early age. I didn’t want any obstacles to my own career dreams. I really didn’t buy the ‘having it all’ theory.\nIt’s a tough field for both men and women, but women especially need to believe in themselves and their work and put themselves out there. The other important thing is to do work you’re passionate about. It’s a long hard road to make independent documentaries, especially in areas that don’t get tons of funding to begin with. So when you’re slogging through the low points, it’s your passion for the subject that will keep you going to the next high. It also helps to have a trust fund.\nHow to Lose Your Virginity on Kickstarter.com. Help Therese reach her fundraising goal."}

There’s a plethora of Italian restaurants and ‘pezzi’ places claiming to be good at putting a bunch of ingredients on dough and baking it. Thing is, they ain’t. The general standard is pretty low on the Berlin pizza scene, surprisingly low, given that there are that many pizza places. The worst offenders are usually those calling themselves Italian, or even Neapolitan, which is the very reason only one pizza place made it onto this site so far: it’s not even trying to be Italian. However, food times change, and there has been somewhat of a revival on the Berlin pizza front of late. Which is why I and some food-savvy friends have gone on a little tasting tour of five new, and fairly hyped, pizza places in the past few weeks.

One of the goals was to move from an upfront planning, waterfall-like development process into a more iterative agile development.\nThe desire to deliver features earlier and more often to the community, as well as to better adapt to devops-managed cloud environments, required changes from the ground up. From how the team manages branches to how it automates builds and how it delivers releases. A challenge for any development team, but even more so to a team that is essentially remote with developers spread all over the world.\nHistorically, Drools, jBPM and Optaplanner aimed for a cadence of 2 releases per year. Some versions with a larger scope took a bit longer, some were a bit faster, but on average that was the norm.\nWith version 7.0 we started a new phase in the project. We are now working with 2-week sprints, and with an overall goal of releasing one minor version every 2 sprints. That is correct, one minor version per month on average.\nWe are currently in a transition phase, but we intend to release version 7.1 at the end of the next sprint (~6 weeks after 7.0), and then we are aiming to release a new version every ~4 weeks after that.\nMore frequent releases gives the community earlier access to new features, allowing users to try them and provide valuable feedback to the core team.\nReducing the scope of each release allows us to do more predictable releases and to improve our testing coverage, maintaining a more stable release stream.\nBug fixes as usual are included in each release, allowing users more frequent access to them as well.\nIf before, we would release version 7.1 around ~6 months after 7.0, we now will release roughly 6 new versions in those 6 months (7.1, 7.2, ..., 7.6 ), but the amount of feature will be relatively equivalent. I.e., the old version 7.1 is roughly equivalent in terms of features as the scope of the new versions 7.1,..., 7.6 combined. It just splits the scope in smaller chunks and delivers earlier and more often.\nUsers that prefer to not update so often will not lose anything. For instance, a user that updated every 6 months can continue to do so, but instead of jumping from one minor version to the next, he will jump 5-6 minor versions. This is not a problem, again, because the scope is roughly the same as before and the backward compatibility between versions is the same.\nThis is of course work in progress and we will continue to evolve and adapt the process to better fit the community's and user's needs. We strongly believe, though, that this is a huge step forward and a milestone on the project maturity level."}

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "Lark. Early bird. Two terms that refer to morning people and something I have been called in the past (along with many other things!). You see, within the Tucker household I am the first to rise at home and enjoy the tranquil atmosphere of the morning with a coffee and read of the newspaper, if there’s time! School days are a little busier, but again I enjoy my time greeting all the staff and pupils at the start of a school day. I thoroughly enjoy my time out on the playground interacting with the children just before the bell rings for the classes to line up.\nThis morning I was discussing with Mrs Carrasco just how well organised the children were, a far cry from my first school. Not only were the pupils slightly less organised, but I could barely see to the rear of the class line. You see, there were 38 children in my first class as a teacher, meaning our class line meandered right around the playground. At Forest Park, there is no such trouble. Not only are the pupils better behaved, more organised and motivated, but there are fewer of them in each class. Something that adds a great deal to our school community.\nFor many parents choosing a school for their child, class size is one of the fundamental features that they look at when making their decision. The main point being that if there are fewer pupils within a class then the child will get more attention and time to learn. This is very true, but there are many other aspects to smaller class sizes that create a positive impact to a child’s development.\nSmall class sizes are essential for good learning and can hugely influence the level of academic excellence achieved by pupils. A report by Professor Peter Blatchford of the Institute of Education, University of London, found that \"in both reading and maths, pupils in small classes performed significantly better than pupils in regular class sizes.\"\nThe academic success at Forest Park comes from teachers being able to spend more one-to-one time with pupils as well as having more time to spend planning and marking work - two key opportunities which are not easily accessible for teachers of regular sized classes. It is important to note that within Trafford the average class size is 30 for infant pupils, but actually increases to averages of 33 in the juniors. We find that at Forest Park, as a consequence of small class sizes, pupils are also better behaved and are more engaged in their learning process. Pupils in small classes ask more questions, discuss more subjects with teachers and are more inquisitive than their regular class size peers.\nThe evidence in favour of small class sizes, combined with exceptional teaching, is overwhelming and as a result, there is no better place for a child to flourish than at Forest Park. Small class sizes are at the core of our philosophy and always have been, for a child being a member of a small class can be extremely powerful in early learning and development and forms a solid foundation for their future progression.\nOur small class sizes (typically 20 children) allow teachers to spend more time with children individually and with small average class sizes throughout the school - you can be sure that all of our children receive the attention and high standard of education that they deserve.\nAt Forest Park, we want our pupils' questions to be listened to and answered, and in a small class, no hand goes unseen and no voice unheard. No child goes without the opportunity to take the lead in a sports activity or in a school performance and this allows their confidence to flourish in preparation for their move into secondary education. All pupils leave our school fully prepared for the challenges a larger class environment brings with the confidence to be heard and seen amongst their peers.\nEvery child knows every other child at Forest Park and as a result they learn to interact and communicate with different age groups giving them another essential life skill. Younger children are inspired by our older children, whereas the older children learn how to care and be responsible for younger ones.\nWe believe in maintaining small class sizes from Pre Prep all the way through to Year 6, meaning that every child will receive a consistently excellent standard of education throughout their entire time at Forest Park. Every child is known and is loved at Forest Park and, therefore, our pupils will never disappear into the crowd."}

Gateshead Central Library was looking to refurbish the main entrance reception with the aim of improving the shop aspect and approached Gateshead Council to see if they could help out.\nThe 2,894m2 Gateshead Central Library underwent a £2.6 million refurbishment in 2011 with Lottery Funding to add a children’s library extension, an art gallery extension, a new main entrance, renovation of the original main entrance, a remodelling of the main lending library complete with a shop plus the refurbishment of all other library areas. During this renovation, the lighting was replaced but it was felt that the latest LED luminaires would not only provide savings in terms of energy and expenditure but also create a brighter, more engaging atmosphere for users.\nA lighting design very specific to the proposed shop layout was required so as to maximise the illumination of the displays. Derek Luke, Senior Mechanical Engineer with Gateshead Council, commented “Gateshead Central Library were looking to refurbish the main entrance reception to improve the shop aspect and enquired whether we could help with LED lighting. Thorn fittings were duly selected to achieve the required illumination but with an economic, flexible design as known future plans for reference library and shops have a habit of changing their layout”.\nChalice and Omega luminaires were chosen for the main entrance and shop, with a design very specific to the proposed shop layout so as to maximise the illumination of the displays. It was equally important that this should be achieved with optimum energy efficiency in support of Gateshead Central Library‘s commitment to sustainability. Thorn’s Chalice is fitted with highly efficient LED’s (up to 100Llm/W) and features a 200mm cut out diameter. Chalice offers energy savings of up to 70% compared to CFL downlights and a long 50,000 hour lifetime with low maintenance requirements. Ideal for low ceiling voids, Chalice has a deep drawn aluminum body to allow a low mounting height of less than 100mm. To meet various lighting demands, Chalice is available in dimmable light outputs of 1300, 2000 and 2800 lumens, with colour temperatures of 3000K and 4000K. It has a CRI of >80, a wide beam and provides a unified glare ratio (UGR) of <22 for maximum visual comfort.\nThorn’s Omega LED uses 50% less energy than a 4x18W T26 (T8) fluorescent with adjustable mounting options for through-life flexibility. Omega provides excellent uniformity and easy retrofit for traditional luminaires. Track lighting was avoided so as to maximise the internal ceiling height which was previously reduced with dated track lighting.\nFor the main library, Thorn’s IQ Wave, with its simple and flowing lines, has created a modern but simplistic aesthetic with a Unified Glare Rating of <19 – compliant to EN12464 which is perfect for the task. IQ Wave has an innovative MV tech optic that offers excellent uniformity, a colour temperature of 4000K and glare control plus direct/indirect light for illuminance on faces and walls to encourage a relaxed and comfortable environment. For ease of installation its new red flag design allows easy access to pull the set up from below the ceiling without the need to remove the optics from the product, allowing for a more secure fixing to the ceiling.\nThe new lighting from Thorn has played a key role in achieving the desired lighting effect, providing the excellent colour rendering was critical to creating the right ambience while showing the merchandise to maximum effect. In addition, the overall lighting has been transformed with improved light quality, high energy savings and lower maintenance costs."}

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "Awkwardly, the UK electorate was not asked if they wanted to reject the single market – merely the EU. A 52% majority voted to leave that. Before the referendum, many Brexiteers (including UKIP’s Nigel Farage) extolled Norway’s EEA-based status. Now, however, many assert that respect for the June 23 vote requires rejecting the single market entirely, including EEA rules. They say voters sought to end contributions, restrict migration, and avoid even the most indirect application of the European Court of Justice decisions – and that these aims would be frustrated by staying in the EEA.\nBritain’s membership of the European single market has become the most contentious issue in the post-Brexit debate. And the legal issues involved are proving rather tricky.\nBritain’s single market membership is the product of not one, but two international organisations and their rules – the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA). This means that interesting questions (and legal cases) are now arising on how Brexit will work.\nMost are by now familiar with Article 50 of the EU Treaty – the formal trigger to leaving the EU. But now, it seems there is another article we might need to trigger – Article 127 of the EEA Agreement – to leave the single market.\nSeparate to the EU’s rules, the UK is also signed up to the rules of the EEA. These have been signed up to by 28 EU member states along with Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland. Thanks to the EEA Agreement, these three states share Europe’s single market with the 28 EU states. But little else – no customs union, or common agriculture or fisheries policies.\nThe EEA owes its 1994 creation to the erstwhile European Commission president, Jacques Delors. His idea was that the EEA would be a kind of economic space absorbing European states into the single market, but without allowing them into what is now the EU – thereby allowing the 12 members of the then European Community (now EU) to continue working toward the creation of the euro currency, as well as internal market reform.\nThe EEA worked out, but somewhat differently than anticipated. There are only three non-EU participant states, rather than the large number Delors envisaged. Some (Finland, Austria and Sweden) joined the EU itself. One, Switzerland, opted out of the EEA entirely.\nNon-EU EEA members are also effectively in what has been termed a “fax union” – meaning that Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland basically sit at the end of a fax machine waiting for the EU to send them single market rules to implement.\nSingle market remainers counter that there was no majority to leave the single market: many reasons for voting for Brexit had nothing to do with the single market (such as a belief that money would be saved, opposition by farmers to the common agricultural policy and fishermen to the fisheries policy – or even Labour voters to austerity). They note future UK contributions will be required anyway to gain market access (as Brexit minister David Davis has now conceded), that restrictions on migration (albeit admittedly limited ones) are possible under Article 112 of the EEA Agreement.\nThe law is unclear about what will happen to the UK’s single market status if it leaves the EU. The UK government asserts that the UK is party to the EEA agreement only in its capacity as an EU member state. So once the UK leaves the EU, it will automatically cease to be a member of the EEA. But that point is arguable.\nArticle 127 of the EEA Agreement expressly provides only one way of withdrawing: giving 12 months notice to other parties. If that provision applies, then just quitting the EU won’t be enough for the UK to leave the EEA’s single market. The UK will have to give express notice to leave the EEA too.\nBut maybe it doesn’t apply. Other provisions of the EEA Agreement seem to assume EU members (like the UK) are only signed up to it because they are in the EU. Leave the EU, this argument goes, and you cause a “fundamental change of circumstances” or a “material breach” under international law governing treaties. So, legally speaking, other states can take the view that you have quit the EEA.\nAll very confusing. We may soon find out who is right, though. The pro-single market group, British Influence, is seeking a judicial review focused on the government’s EEA position. British Influence would like the Article 127-is-needed view to prevail (and parliament to then refuse to consent to Article 127 notice and the UK to live happily ever after – or at least for a very long time – in the EEA).\nThere are UK law issues here too. And political issues. The Supreme Court is currently weighing up a legal challenge brought by Gina Miller regarding whether or not parliament’s consent is needed under UK law to trigger Article 50.\nIf the Supreme Court say “no”, parliamentary consent will hardly be needed to trigger Article 127 either. That would be the end of the Article 127 story. The government will just give the Article 127 notice and say goodbye to the EEA.\nIf the Supreme Court say “yes”, then parliament’s consent will be needed for EEA exit too. But here is the catch: parliamentarians may not give it, claiming there has been no referendum on the UK’s single market membership.\nContinued EEA membership would have huge consequences for Britain’s economic well-being for generations. So the courts – and potentially parliament too – have weighty issues to ponder. First in the Miller case. And now perhaps in the British Influence case too."}

After 13 years as a veteran of the variated wonderments of the experimental music scenes of the east coast, Katt moved to Sweden. She became a producer at Fylkingen and several other organizations for new and experimental music, started making electro-acoustic music alongside her long beloved violin at EMS and the Royal Music Academy alike, and is playing all about Sweden and further with a burgeoning tumult of new and fantastic musicians. Eight years after her first record Katt’s violin world, full of micro-tonalities, spectral harmonics, invisible artifacts and secret ululating tales of the impossible, has morphed in this new place.\nThis is a record for Stockholm, recorded at EMS with a microphone only three examples were ever made of. The title is the simultaneous two languages which now twine together: ”Lent skiner solen på själens skinn / The sun shines down softly on the skin of the soul.” The improvisations, done entirely on the acoustic violin and in single takes, build upon listening to the moving of huge granite mountains for the building of things on Stockholms stone terrain, and the stones and machines in all the cities waterways found with hydrophones- on the songs of the new birds here, and the trains, and the hours the sun came forth until midnight and disappeared over a hundred years of rising and setting. It is for the endlessly disappearing and re-emerging versions of the city and the people who live in those tides.\nThe LP is co-released on Ehse in the USA and Fylkingen Records in Sweden."}

Departments were invited to submit bids to Council for objectives they would like to see included in the Campaign’s portfolio. The School of Geography sent in a proposal for the establishment of a new unit to study Environmental Change and, at the suggestion of Sir Richard Southwood, the Departments of Zoology and Plant Sciences (which included Forestry) were subsequently invited to participate in this proposal. Council duly agreed that the Environmental Change Unit (ECU) would be one of the key fund-raising priorities of Campaign for Oxford. Professor Goudie, then Head of Geography, was appointed leader of the task force to take this forward, and some Development Office staff, notably Ian Curtis and Jitka Fort, were charged with helping with the fund-raising efforts.\nThere were two reasons why Geography put forward the vision of the ECU. The first was an internal one. Geography was a rather traditional department with an emphasis on undergraduate teaching, relatively modest research grant income, and a need to strengthen its research culture. On the other hand, it had a number of very active individuals in both physical and human geography for whom studies at the interface between people and the environment were a long-standing focus. The second reason was an external one. As the 1980s progressed it became more and more apparent to researchers in Geography that global environmental change was going to become a great issue of trans-disciplinary concern. It was an issue that required new money and new people if Oxford was to be a major player in this nascent field.\nThus fund-raising was pursued with vigour and in due course sufficient money was raised to make the ECU a reality. In particular, IBM UK provided funds for a Directorship at professorial level for five years, Merton College provided a small, refurbished building in Mansfield Road, and over a thousand graduates contributed essential \"unrestricted funds\". The ECU was launched on February 14th 1991 in the School of Geography, with speeches from Professor Goudie, Sir Anthony Cleaver (Chairman and Chief Executive of IBM UK), Sir Crispin Tickell (Warden of Green College and President of the Royal Geographical Society) and Professor Sir Richard Southwod (Vice-Chancellor). As stated in the University’s Statutes, Decrees and Regulations, \"The functions of the unit shall be to organize and promote interdisciplinary research on the nature, causes and impact of environmental change and to contribute to the development of management strategies for coping with future environmental change\".\nProfessor Martin Parry was appointed as the first Director and started in October 1991 with 12 staff and a budget of £1.1 million. By October of the following year he had 22 staff and had made the first intake of graduate students. He became a Fellow of Linacre, a college which under Sir Bryan Cartledge had seen the importance of environmental concerns (including establishing the pioneering and now long-running Linacre Lecture series). Another crucial development was the success of St Hilda’s in obtaining money from Powergen to support a fellowship in Energy Efficiency. This was to be associated with the ECU. Dr Brenda Boardman of the University of Sussex was appointed in 1991 and brought with her Dr John Boardman, who was an ideal person to help run a proposed new taught masters course but also to undertake research on soil erosion and land degradation. Other major early funders included Nuclear Electric plc and the MOA Foundation.\nThe ECU benefitted greatly from the establishment of a highly distinguished Advisory Council, chaired initially by Professor Southwood, and having among its members Sir Tony Cleaver, Sir Crispin Tickell, Sir Victor Blank, John Gummer, and the late Lord Holme of Cheltenham. (It is now chaired by Professor Tim O’Riordan, one of the founding fathers of UK environmental science).\nThe initial research programmes were in Climate Impacts and Responses (led by Dr Tom Downing), Energy and the Environment (led by Dr B. Boardman) and Long-term Environmental Change (led by Dr Alayne Perrott). By 1994-5 there were also programmes in Land Degradation and Rehabilitation, Mountain Regions, and Environmental Laws and Institutions.\nVery importantly, the taught MSc course in Environmental Change and Management was started in October 1994 with 15 students, and was led in its early years by Professor Michael Williams (Course Director), and Dr J Boardman (Course Co-ordinator). Dr Boardman succeeded Professor Williams as Course Director, a post he held until 2008. The course’s purpose was \"to equip promising students from all over the world, and from different backgrounds, with the technical and other skills needed to put essential environmental policies into action.\" Over 120 students from 30 countries applied for the first year. Now there are regularly around over 200 applicants for just over 30 places. In all some 400 students from over 60 countries have successfully graduated and many hold high positions in government, NGOs and business.\nThe early years of the ECU were not easy. The first two directors, Professor Parry (October 1991-March 1994) and Professor Richard Macrory (November 1994-1996) did not stay in post for as long as was hoped. There was also some competition for funds from other environmental centres that were subsequently established in Oxford itself (for example, at Mansfield College), and the environment had still not become the big issue that it is today (despite the immense publicity surrounding the 1992 Rio Earth Summit) . Fund-raising was a challenge, not least in North America. Nonetheless, under the directorships of Professor Jim Briden (1997-2003), Professor Diana Liverman (2003-2009), Acting Director Professor David Banister (2009-2010) and, most recently, Professor Jim Hall (2010 to present), the ECU (now ECI) has prospered. On November 23rd 1999 it became the Environmental Change Institute (ECI) and in October 2005 it moved in to new, larger premises in the Oxford University Centre for the Environment in the old Dyson Perrins chemistry department. The vision of the early days has been vindicated: the ECI has over 60 research staff; large numbers of doctoral students (36 in 2007); its budget in 2006-7 exceeded £2.8 million; it has a number of very successful new research programmes to add to those in climate and energy including biodiversity and ecosystem dynamics (including the Trapnell Fellowship in African Terrestrial Ecology and Jackson Fellowship in Biodiversity and Conservation); it is home to UKCIP (the United Kingdom Climate Impacts Programme); it is a founding member of the Oxford Martin School; it is one of the core partners of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research (the UK’s principal consortium mobilizing climate change science and policy research) and of the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC), and has one of the most successful and influential Master’s courses in the world.\nThe ECI’s founding benefactors will perhaps be inspired by the Institute’s breadth and depth of research and education achievements - as were the founding staff with the former’s generosity and vision."}

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "Evergreen Review by Biz Books Columnist Jim Pawlak | Fleming Consulting & Co.\nHere’s a review of Evergreen from Jim Pawlak for his nationally syndicated column – Biz Books. This review will appear in various newspapers across the United States.\n“Evergreen: Cultivate the Enduring Customer Loyalty that Keeps Your Business Thriving” by Noah Fleming (AMACOM, $26). Fleming lays the foundation for customer-centric principles with “3 Cs” – Character, Community and Content. All of the 3Cs involves two other Cs, connection and consistency, which entrench customer loyalty.\nCharacter embodies the personality of the brand. It presents the traits that shape the perception of products/services. That perception starts with your company’s stories. These deal with the who and why of the firm. They explain the what and how behind the company’s vision, commitment and purpose that makes it unique. To craft your stories, Fleming provides a series of questions; your answers write your story. The stories aren’t just for the customer. They’re for your employees; the company’s stories remind them that how they do their jobs reinforces the customer’s perception of your brand.\nCommunity provides a sense of belonging to customers. It shows the company’s interests in their interests, viewpoints and values. Community deals with interaction and showcases how well the firm listens. Showing that you learn from the customer’s voice improves connection. Your responses freshen your stories; you can be sure that the customers will spread the word.\nFleming’s research discovered that “as connection to the brand and community increases, customer support and service requests may actually decrease.” Why? Customer input helps you nip potential problems in the bud.\nHe offers a word of caution about creating community: Don’t think just in terms of obtaining feedback, provide information and things that bring community members together. Example: Ferrari Chat provides an online communications forum for Ferrari owners. It’s the go-to place to post event information, and tech and restoration questions. This community also includes service providers that connect their expertise.\n“Content is the core ‘thing’ that the customer receives in exchange for money.” Most companies believe that content is THE ONLY THING that keeps customers coming back. Far from it. An engaged-customer experience requires the support of character and community. Without ongoing customer involvement, a business becomes transaction-based. Only relationships create loyalty.\nChapter 7, “Getting Loyalty Programs Right,” alone is worth the price of the book because of its counterintuitive approach to loyalty programs. Most of these focus on rewarding their best customers. Yet, when it comes to ROI, the best customers offer diminishing returns because they’re already using the product/service. While the best are important to maintaining community, they’re only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to expanding community – and profits.\nNot-so-loyal customers offer a higher ROI because their use of content can grow. Starbucks realizes this. Like all loyalty programs, it tracks and categorizes members by spending, number of visits, products purchased, etc. Based upon the data, Starbucks creates specific marketing programs for the not-so-loyal, and can tailor the programs by store.\nIts programs don’t just target increasing frequency of use. They ask customers about their perception of Starbucks and its community. By including brand-interaction and customer-experience opportunities, it invites customers to the community. Once they join, sales and profits increase.\nFleming discusses the loyalty ladder. It has multiple rungs so the customer wants to climb. The airlines got that part right. The part they got wrong was making it difficult to use the perks. That said, it’s not all about the perks. There should be intrinsic rewards. Fleming cites a restaurant that offers a members-only menu along with its regular menu. The members are recognized and non-members see that signing up for the loyalty program has a benefit.\nYou can also literally sell loyalty. Amazon Prime is an example. You don’t have to be Amazon, a craft brewery/restaurant near me has a $20 Mug Club; there are Mug Club-only events every month.\nKey takeaway: It costs less to strengthen relationships than it does to develop them."}

Sometimes I stop listening to the news for a few days and that helps me feel better. I also know that what helps me is to look my best.\nWhen I say this, I don't mean to deny what's going on. I simply mean that when you look better, you feel better. It is that simple and sometimes that complicated. It's important for all of us to find ourselves and then show up accordingly. If we don't, it can make us feel more uncertain... and in an uncertain world, nothing good can come from that.\nI don't know about you, but I always get a little melancholy about this time of year. I think back on the past year and my choices and plans and I want to make sure that I'm choosing the right course and that I'm being true to myself. That's not always easy to do as the world gets wrapped up around us and we start looking outside of ourselves to keep us happy.\nFor me, what works is quiet time every morning. I go to my office, open up my journal, turn on my Alaska Northern Light (see below) and proceed to immerse myself in good \"stuff.\" It might be a daily devotion or a special book a friend has sent me. Or, it may surprise you to know that sometimes in my quiet time, I read Vogue magazine. Not for the articles, mind you, but for the pictures! I love the beautiful colors and fashions and the outlooks for the next season. For me, this magazine is pure fun. For someone else it might be an outdoor magazine or an activity magazine of some kind. Because it's a time that is all about me, I avoid any \"self help\" magazines at this hour. My goal is a feel good moment and I almost always get it with my fashion mags.\nI'm not trying to \"look like a model\" in this time alone in the morning... I'm trying to find what my personal look is and stash the pictures in my personal file. It's fun to discover something new about myself and it often just makes me smile.\nMy morning goals have changed over the years. I used to think it had to be very guided and serious. Now I take myself less seriously. I find a fun look or a great color and I try it on in my mind. It's my time in the morning when I get to create my own look and then when I'm out and about, I can recreate it for real if the feeling hits me.\nAs we head into the new year when much is uncertain, I challenge you to take each day as it comes. To enjoy the moment when possible and to move on when you make a mistake. Above all, take some time for yourself every day, in whatever manner works best for you. You may be surprised at what you discover.\nLight therapy can be beneficial to people living in areas like the Pacific Northwest, where the amount of natural sunlight we get is less than optimal. I love my light box, and make sure I spend time with it every day during our cloudy winters.\nJill Helman is the owner of this wonderful spa that offers one of my favorite pampering items: the spray-on tan. Can't take a vacation and get to the sun? Indulge in a little spraycation! Sweet Skin is in a great location, just north of University Village.\nMichael is hands-down my favorite makeup artist.

Rick Larsen, D-Arlington, has been heavily involved in the process. In a statement, Larsen that he is disappointed an agreement could not be reached. Yet he suggested something still might be worked out.\n“I will continue to work with both parties in the hopes of finding a solution that appropriately funds the preservation of cultural landmarks,” he said in the statement.\nThe Navy determined in June that an increase in Growler aircraft carrier landing practice at Outlying Field Coupeville would have an indirect adverse effect on the historic property and structures in the reserve. Under the Navy’s preferred plan, the number of Growlers will increase by 36 and the total number of field carrier landing practice operations will increase by 370 percent at OLF Coupeville.\n“Specifically, the preferred alternative would affect the historic integrity of five landscape viewpoints within the historic district,” a Navy press release states.\nUnder the federal Section 106 process, the Navy was required to consult with other agencies in coming to an agreement about how the Navy should mitigate the impacts. The National Historic Preservation Act allows a federal agency to terminate consultation if an agreement can’t be reached.\nThe first clue that negotiations weren’t going well came in late October with the Navy’s decision to ask for public comment on a memorandum of agreement even though there was no agreement.\nIn the press release issued Friday, Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces Command put the blame on the consulting partners.\nIn contrast, Kristen Griffin, reserve manager, said she believes that Navy officials terminated discussion because they ran out of time before the Navy releases its final decision regarding the number of Growlers and where the landing practice will occur. The decision is expected to be announced any day now.\n“They left very little time for what turned out to be a complex consultation,” she said.\nAllyson Brooks, state historic preservation officer, said interested parties across the state and country were discussing possible mitigation scenarios all day Friday but received the notice of termination at 4:28 p.m. that day.\n“We felt we were still negotiating,” she said.\nThe Navy sent a press release explain the decision about 10 minutes later.\nThe sticking point, Griffin said, was defining the scale of the impact the change will have on historic properties. And that comes down to money.\nUnder the Navy’s draft agreement, it would provide a total of $450,000 for preservation work, a cultural landscape inventory and a gateway sign.\nIn contrast, the Trust Board of Ebey’s Landing National Historical Reserve suggested $2 million to stabilize concrete structures in Fort Casey and Fort Ebey state parks, $2 million to rehabilitate the Coupeville Wharf and $1.8 million for work preserving the Ferry House.\nGriffin said the board chose projects that would reinforce the partnership between the entities involved in the reserve — National Parks, the town of Coupeville and state parks. The board also chose structures that are publicly accessible.\nIn a Nov. 21 letter to the secretary of the Navy, Larsen urged him to agree to providing $2 million for the Ferry House and $2 million for the Coupeville Wharf.\n“Funding for the preservation of these two iconic, historic structures in Ebey’s Reserve is appropriate mitigation for the increase in planes and operations at the Coupeville OLF,” the letter states.\nWashington Gov. Jay Inslee also touched on the issue in a Oct. 26 letter to the Navy.\n“To mitigate this effect, the U.S. Navy should provide funding to stabilize historic barns and structures as well as soundproof historic homes, helping to preserve the sense of community in this unique setting,” he wrote."}

One study looked at air pollution exposure in pregnant women and found that the pollutant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) is linked with higher rates of childhood obesity. PAH is a common urban pollutant, which is released into the air from the burning of coal, diesel, oil and gas, or other organic substances such as tobacco. In a group of children who were followed from the gestation period to age 7, researchers found that the children of mothers with high levels of exposure were almost twice as likely to be obese at age 5, compared with children of mothers with lower levels of PAH exposure during pregnancy. The children of higher levels of exposure were also more than twice as likely to be obese at age 7.\nIn the second study, researchers at UCLA studied gestational growth-restricted offspring in animal models. From their experiment, they found that the hypothalamus region of the brain is affected in low-birth-weight babies, resulting in a natural tendency to eat more calories.\nThese studies emphasize the fact that there are many contributors to today’s obesity epidemic. Childhood obesity is an escalating issue in the United States, with experts predicting that a diabetes epidemic is looming as a generation of heavy kids become adults. Many of the patients we work with have been battling obesity since childhood. The American Heart Association recently released a set of recommendations for parents who want to be active in combating childhood obesity in their own homes.

When I was about four, I lived in a small house in Kenniwick, Washington with my mom, brother and a family of drug addicts that are friends with my dad who is a trucker.\nI don’t remember how long this had been going on but my mom said it was about three weeks. Every night when I went to sleep I kept waking up for some reason.\nAbout the second week I woke up in the morning and told my mom to tell her friends to keep waking me up. My mom then told me that every night for two weeks she had witnessed a tall black haired lady in white walk from my room to the bathroom, and every time my mom went to look she was gone.\nAt the third week my mom got tired of me telling her to tell her friends to stop. She called my aunt (whom lived 500 miles away) and told her. After that it stopped happening.\nWe then moved to a small town of Rosalia. The first six years I felt no presence here.

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "nick johnson hails form the brackish Chesapeake Bay but now calls Oakland home. He’s good at telling long-winded stories, making spicy curries, Instagraming, and drinking whiskey; typically in that order, but not always. His work has appeared in Black Renaissance Noire, Brilliant Corners, The Cincinnati Review, Metazen, sPARKLE & bLINK, and other fine places. His book music for mussolini is forthcoming from Nomadic Press. Find him on facebook at facebook.com/Nick.J.Lee and twitter @wordsfromnickyj.\nIt really depends. I kinda read the person and guess what they are getting at…if they’re asking how I make money or if they’re asking what my passion is… and I base my answer on that. I’ll typically say something like, I’m a poet… but you can’t make a living as a poet so I work at a Media Technology Startup. The Media Tech job is a new thing so sometimes I lead with that because I enjoy the work. I guess it really depends on whether I wanna talk poetry or business.\nI struggle with self-editing poems before I actually commit them to paper. I really don’t like writing things until I feel like they’re “good” so that means not writing a lot… and most writers will tell you write, write, write… you know exercise those skills. But when I try to force myself to write I just end up saying this is crap and I toss it out. It’s a serious struggle.\nDevelop a thick skin, and try to detach yourself from your work; and at the same time try to hold true to yourself and your voice. I think they are things that you can never really master but the practice will teach you about yourself and your craft.\nAbsolutely, this year has been phenomenal. My manuscript music for mussolini was accepted for publication by Nomadic Press and is slated to come out in February of 2016. Publishing a book of poems has been a life long dream so seeing this manifest has been amazing; and J.K. Fowler, Michaela Mullin and the folks at Nomadic Press have been an absolute joy to work with on this project. I started my new job in August and that’s been great. And most recently, I became engaged to the most wonderful, talented, and supportive woman I’ve known. So all is well with art, business, and love… what more could you ask for?\nBeing African American, and given this nation’s history, it’s difficult to answer a question like this… I can only say that I would like to know stories about my ancestors. Yeah, I’ll leave it at that.\nMy mom; she was a single mother and worked extremely hard to provide me with the best life she could. She was extremely giving, and thoughtful, and kind. She had a blood disease called Sickle Cell Anemia so when I was young I wanted to be a doctor so I could find a cure… you know, one of those cute dreams kids have. One thing I came to appreciate later in life, about my mother, was that she never pushed me to be something other than what I wanted to become. I remember her telling me when I was young, “find something you like doing, and then think about how you want to get paid for it.” I think she’s one of the main reasons I’m a writer… I found what I wanted to do and I’m doing it… I’m still working out that whole thing about getting paid for it though, lol.\nA week in the wilderness… I like this question! Chelsea (my fiancé) and I love camping, I guess it’s actually glamping the way we do it, but to each his own, right? I think a week of camping would be ideal. So let’s see, it would be Spring so it wouldn’t be too hot. We’d have two coolers one full of beer, premixed cocktails, and sparkling wine, the other full of home made curries, salads, and breakfast foods. Our campsite would be close to a little stream and under redwoods. We’d have a few days to ourselves to go on long hikes, swim, and do silent walking meditations. We’d spend the evenings snuggled next to a fire with a bottle of champagne. Then after three days or so our friends would join us. And it would turn into a big party; we’d play cards, play music around the campfire, all that good stuff… oh and they would bring the block-rocker for late night dance parties, gotta have late night dance parties.\nOf course I would… I won’t describe it though… you just have to use your imagination.\nSo, so much. But if I had to boil it all down, or think what’s at the root of society’s problems I would say it is a combination of greed and a lack of understanding and compassion for others. A little less selfishness and a bit more compassion can make a huge impact; try to live with that as a centering thought for a just one day and tell me it doesn’t make a difference.\nRiding in a tiny paddleboat through a flooded mangrove forest in Cambodia; listening to the sound of the oar hit the water, pull slowly out and hit the water again, and our guide humming, quietly to herself, while Chelsea and I lied on our backs hand in hand watching the sky through the trees.\nI would like to see more compassion and understanding for one another, more openness and acceptance of ideas, expressions, faiths, and beliefs that differ from our own.\nEquality; gender, racial, and marriage equality.\nLess exploitation and more empowerment.\nWhen it’s done best, art is pure expression coaxed into form. And it is absolutely necessary, it’s pedagogy and therapy so deeply intertwined that the two are indistinguishable.\nI like to use peanut butter.\nI admire work that bears its soul, that strips itself down and by way of reading it, strips you down in the process. Work that makes you a little raw, that opens up old wounds and pokes around looking for something you’ve long since forgotten. And then it heals that same wound without you knowing how; it softens your scars a bit. That’s the kind of work I love, and what I hope I’m doing when I’m writing poems.\nThe real estate market and income disparities; without a doubt, that’s what is ruining this city and it has to change, and quickly.\nIdeally, that means Chelsea and I having a light snack before heading out for drinks with friends and then probably some dancing, but as long as the night ends at Taqueria Cancun I’m happy.\nI think 50 words sounds like more than it really is… I mean I write short poems but they typically come in somewhere between 80-100 words. I have some 50 word poems… but not many. So most likely, I could write a stanza with 50 words. With 50 bucks, I could buy one ticket to see Bonobo (he’s coming to town soon), and have enough to get money left over to get 3 carne asada super tacos at Taqueria Cancun (which I should really get for free now after plugging them twice, lol).\nIndian food, especially fresh baked naan. Jasmine. Nag Champa.\nWithout a doubt, a trip around the world with my fiancé; that would be so EPIC!"}

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "Ligaments are the parts that hold the bones in their apt place that ensures proper action of the bones. In the case of a knee four such ligaments keep the bones and in place and damage to any one of the ligaments would result in knee becoming arthritic. Replacement of such ligaments by artificial means is called prosthesis. There are two ways by which replacement or substitution to ensure the bone in the right place could be effected. One is cemented knee replacement and the other is cement-less knee replacement.\nThis is the most popular process among the two and has a high success rate. In cemented replacement a special kind of cement called as polymethylmethacrylate is used which cements the joint with vigour and keeps the bone at its exact location. The cement creates a perfect fixing through mechanical bonding between the cement used and the bones. Such fixations have a long life of even up to 20 years. The life of it of course depends mostly on the activity level of the patient, body weight and also the health condition.\nFailures in this kind mostly happen due to mechanical reasons and also biological reasons. Bio reasons are created when the bone debris is detected by the natural tissues and when they consider the joint as a foreign material they try to remove them and cause inflammation and also infection.\nThis type of fixation mostly relies on the growth of the bone over the surface of the implant after replacement. Surface properties of the replacement are generally coated with a texture that induces natural growth of bones over it. To initially keep the bones in place artificial means like bolts and even pegs in cases are used that will be removed when the bone is retained and strengthen in a natural way. This process requires a long healing period as it relies on the natural growth of the bones.\nHigh active persons have chances of failure in this process and debris created might create inflammation that could result in failures even. For short term replacement processes cementless knee replacement is found to work in an excellent way."}

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "Despite a claim in 2017 that they would do more to crack down on Hate Speech on their platform, after a massive exodus Hate Videos: YouTube Has Done almost Nothing to Prevent Hate Speech from Showing Up of advertisers, YouTube is still the main source of hate videos worldwide, with almost nothing done to actually prevent them from showing up on their site.\nVideos of the shooting in New Zealand kept on showing up yesterday and today, even though a simple keyword addition to their programming would have solved it.\nIn fact, their own policy is not to remove most of them, but if they are found, to put them in a “digital purgatory” where you have to “agree” to see the often racist and violent videos.\nTheir claim is those videos aren’t “monetized” but many of them still drive people, and thus revenue to other videos which are. Why not remove them completely?\nIn fact, well known hate peddlers including the BraveHeart Show, are still being shown despite articles since 2010 bringing up this little hate channel, where the Pastor is known to burn Korans.\nI’ve personally brought up this one channel as an example of their inability to police their own content over and over to YouTuve – and they’ve told me they would look into it, over and over. It’s almost like they are keeping it up to “make a point” that they are okay with hate speech, and just will “take care of it” in their own way.\nYouTube has created algorithms for finding stolen music and videos, and has even given special access to the music companies to help flag and take them down. YouTube relies on good relationships with the companies that own TV shows, movies, and music because they SUED them years ago to force them to work with them.\nSo the site spent a lot of time and money developing a Content ID system. YouTube lets anyone register their content with Content ID and hunt down infringers in fact, but does absolutely nothing similar with hate speech.\nWhile I understand 600,000 hours of new video are added to YouTube each day. However, creating a system which these videos can be flagged by experts and an algorithm that looks for keywords (like Mosque Shooting) isn’t actually that hard.\nIn fact, The problem cannot be solved by humans and it shouldn’t be solved by humans,” Google’s chief business officer Philipp Schindler told Bloomberg News. They seem to agree.\nYouTube has also been the top source for misinformation about mass shootings.\nThe Guardian newspaper for example found that survivors and the relatives of victims of numerous shootings have been subject to a wide range of online abuse and threats, some tied to popular conspiracy theory ideas featured prominently on YouTube.\nAs I mentioned on Twitter, quite a few employees of YouTube read my newsletters and read the articles. They are aware of these issues – and I’ve personally spoken and written to them about it for years. They only decided to take action in 2017 after we shamed them, and they seem to be taking the same exact policy decision now.\nI've had meetings with @YouTube for over a decade about putting filters up for hate videos. hundreds of executives read my newsletters.\nThey've developed technology for the movie and music companies to detect stolen tracks.\nPart of the reason is people like Candace Owens pushing the theory that removing anti-Jewish and anti-Islam videos is an attack on “conservative speech.” They’ve started to consider this far-right wing ideology “mainstream” because of the pushback by some talking heads that everyone has a right to spew their hatred.\nYouTube and google have a responsibility to it’s advertisers that this doesn’t continue – even though likely it will.\nThey’ve shown a lack of being proactive and have only ever adjusted when they are caught lying or exposed."}

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "Juicing is a simple way to get in your nutrients. Every day we’re supposed to have eight to ten servings of fruits and vegetables. And the problem is today people don’t get those, so it is a simple way to getting your daily servings.\nJuice: the tastiest component of any fruit or vegetable. Unfortunately, not all juice is created equal. The same two kale leaves can land at opposite ends of the nutrition and taste scales, just because they were juiced differently.\nThe best way to ensure your kale leaves are juiced right? Learn the top thirteen benefits of cold-pressed juicing. Once you drink this knowledge down, we challenge you to choose generic juice ever again.\nAnd by good stuff, we mean vitamins and enzymes that can get lost or destroyed by commercial juicing methods. If your juice is pasteurized, that process brings all the ingredients to a very high temperature for a short time.\nIt then gets immediately cooled down, and along the way certain chemicals are applied to these ingredients to ensure harmful bacteria does not form during packaging. Unfortunately, that means that any good bacteria also gets zapped out of your juice at the same time.\nThe same drawbacks exist with traditional centrifugal or rotary juicers. The process of shredding fruits and vegetables with blades exposes the produce to air and speeds up oxidation. And this can cause massive casualties to good bacteria, enzymes and vitamins.\nAccording to a study conducted by the Huffington Post. Ounce per ounce, you extract more juice from a cold-pressed juicer than from other types of juicers.\nThis is especially true of leafy greens, and those are the ones that you want to be leaching to the max because they’re full of chlorophyll. This efficiency means that you save money because it takes less produce to give you your daily juice fix with a cold-pressed juicer. The same carrot will yield more juice from a cold-pressed juicer than from a traditional centrifugal juicer.\nOur bodies take a lot of energy to digest food to break down into smaller components to take the vitamins, minerals and the nutrients and to separate it from the other food components.\nIn this process, some of the vitamins and minerals that you’ve eaten from the food are being used up to feed the digestive process. So when you’re juicing because it’s already in liquid form you don’t need to use up that same amount of energy.\nYou’re not losing those nutrients to digestion, so we have all this extra energy inside of us. And because we’re not using it to digest the food itself this extra energy after several days of doing a juice cleanse your body. And divert the energy to repair cells, regenerate them and make your body healthier.\nIt’s an efficient way to get a ton of nutrients, dimes and vitamins directly into your system. Because the fibers removed during the juicing process. All of those great things hit your bloodstream immediately and are absorbed right away.\nMaybe you’re already getting your five a day, but for a lot of people, getting the right amount of greens they need every day can be a struggle. Drinking cold-pressed juice is a natural and very efficient way of increasing your consumption of raw fruits and vegetables in just one sitting.\nIf you can make cold-pressed juicing a habit, then you’re making a significant step forward towards a proactive healthy lifestyle.\nIt’s also an efficient way to get fresh fruits and vegetables into your diet. There are about four to five pounds of fresh fruits and vegetables which would be way too much to eat in one sitting. But because it’s pressed and juiced into a bottle, it’s easy to get.\nYou can get it on the go, and you’re getting all those great benefits quickly. If you have to chew fruits and vegetables, then it will take so much time compared to juicing.\nThere’s a ton of research out there that all seem to point to the same conclusion. Having a good intake of raw vegetables and fruits as part of your daily diet improves your energy levels.\nAccording to an article on Cold-Pressed Juicing by a health expert, and New York Times best-selling author, Dr Mercola. This is because your blood gets flooded with nutrients and your body’s pH is optimized.\nAs juice is absorbed very rapidly by your body. cold-pressed juicing drinkers regularly talk about feeling an almost instantaneous energy kick within a few minutes of drinking their cold-pressed juice. It’s like nature’s espresso shot.\nThe nutrients in cold-pressed juice feed your body’s good bacteria, and these little guys help to suppress pathogenic bacteria. Again, an article by Dr Mercola concludes that cold-pressed juice has all the raw goodness of nutrients and vitamins in it.\nThese can supercharge your immune system with concentrated phytochemicals and biophotonic light energy. This starts to get quite ‘sciency’ , but it boils down to the same advice you get from your doctor during flu season.\nIf you want to stay healthy and avoid illness, take your vitamins. And a cold-pressed juice is like a multivitamin only it’s actually enjoyable to take and comes with a bunch of other benefits as well.\nIf mornings are a sacred time for you, then nothing is more likely to get you off to a bad start than a machine that sounds like a lawn mower shredding through your harvest of fresh fruits and vegetables.\nA cold-pressed juicer can perform a superior juicing function. And you won’t miss a single chime from your meditation playlist while it does its thing. It’s just a gentle hum in the background, like a yogi.\nCold-pressed juice allows for better absorption. It gives your digestive system a break. When you remove the fibre and the pulp from the juice, it enters your digestive system in the small intestine where all the absorption happens. And that results in increased energy and allows all of your other organs to work more efficiently and effectively.\nYou absorb more because the body does not have to work hard that’s why cancer patients are advised to take the juice. Because they need to consume as many nutrients as possible, they can get. The cold-pressed juicing allows for maximum absorption of all the vitamins and minerals that are inside the juice.\nYou’re going to look and feel great from the inside out: juicing results in clearer brighter skin clear more shining eyes, less bloating weight loss, less water retention.\nYou are not only going to get the inside benefits, but you’ll be able to see them from the outside well.\nThis is going to sound far-fetched, but it’s true: cold-pressed juice tastes better. From the other enzymes and vitamins to the fact that the fruits and vegetables have had minimal handling the taste you get is much fresher.\nIf you don’t believe us, make your own Pepsi challenge of cold-pressed juice versus pasteurized or generic juice, and experience it for yourself. Trust on this; your taste buds will never let you go back!\nBenefit #13: Improve Your Overall Health.\nWhen you have cold-pressed juice, you have juice in a form that your body recognizes and responds to. When you drink the juice, your body absorbs and utilize everything because it has the enzymes and the nutrients inside of it.\nWhat Does Cold Pressed Juice Mean - How Does It Work?\nWhat Does Cold Pressed Juice Mean – How Does It Work?"}

All of these things you’ll notice on your own when you get here, but the fruits and music can be hard to decode so a head’s up is all you really need before arrival.\nI haven’t taken formal Spanish classes in 15 months of living in Colombia, yet the slang I picked up helps me relate to the locals immediately, and on a very authentic level. Plus, it’s a lot of fun!\nThe regular price for Spanish in Colombia is $7.95, however this week August is running a sale on the Kindle version, which you can get for just $0.99 on Amazon.com.\n$0.99 puts this well into impulse category… Purchased already.

Chinese is the first time I really applied myself to learning a language. Everyone says that Spanish is easy but I don’t speak it at all so I’m curious to see what the acquisition process is like for a language like that.\nAs I know you know, immersion is the best approach. I had Colombians surprised I didn’t have conversational fluency after just 2-3 months of living in Medellin. If you’re disciplined, and/or get some formal tutoring/teaching I think you can pick it up really fast."}

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "So there’s this thing us physicists do pretty much any time we have to model something about the real world: we simplify the situation. We have a basketball? Who cares about air resistance or a bit of energy lost on the bounce? Of course the ground is perfectly flat and frictionless, the ball changes direction instantaneously, and you know what, let’s not even worry about that pesky third dimension. Who needs depth anyways?\nBut what would the world look like if these assumptions weren’t just assumptions, but rather traits of the world we lived in? And so I present to you a new world, one where the physicists get to run the simulation for a change.\nPart One: Death and destruction. Probably the most common assumption within any first-year student’s calculations is that all surfaces are smooth and frictionless.\nIt’s hard to say exactly how many people are driving a car at any given time, but the average American adult spends about 100 minutes a day driving in a country of about 260 million cars.\nThe rest of the world combined, however, only has about three times as many cars as the U.S., but if they’re all driven roughly as much as an American car is, we can estimate that there’s about 60 million people on the road at any given time, or rather, there were 60 million people on the road until friction was turned off to save on computation time.\nNow there are 60 million people in a ditch, or sliding across some hapless farmer’s field, or more likely, hitting a bunch of small objects — traffic cones, tumbleweeds, shrapnel from nearby collisions — which sends them scattering across a slip-n’-slide world, while their car slides with nothing but air resistance to… Hmm, that reminds me.\nPart Two: More death and destruction. I think we can all agree that air resistance is really pesky. It’s not the easiest factor to model in the first place. Air is a fluid and fluids are notoriously hard to apply physics to. So let’s turn that off, too.\nNewton’s first law states that an object in motion will remain in motion. Never has this statement been more true. Physicists everywhere rejoice, slip, and fall over. Meanwhile, about 20,000 pilots and co-pilots are suddenly very surprised when they find themselves falling out of the sky. You see, planes could be said to stay in the air due to air resisting the pull of gravity. It’s not a good description, but it is a description.\nUsing a gloriously simple kinematics calculation, we’ll find that exactly 24.9 seconds pass before the world’s passenger planes — all flying neatly at 10,000 feet off course — come smashing into the ground. At the moment of impact, the horizontal speed of the plane matches almost exactly the vertical speed, roughly 250 metres per second or 880 kilometres per hour.\nThe statisticians on board find brief satisfaction in this fact before being crushed under the force of the collision.\nPart three: Peace and harmony. I’m just kidding, of course. Emboldened by the sudden ease of physics everywhere (and the necessity-no-longer of wool socks to slide around your living room) the physicists in charge of our simulation decide to flip all the switches at once, turning the world into a homogenous frictionless sphere of uniform density in a vacuum, but without all those crazy and difficult equations of special and general relativity, where everything is nice and no energy is lost during collisions and — oh wait, we need air to breathe, right?\nPart four: The universe is now blissfully simple. Across the black void of the universe, all that remains is a single, perfect blue marble.\nA man in a creaky office chair glances over at his computer that, after 13.8 billion years, finally stops whirring. “Huh,” he says to no one in particular. Following wisdom older than time, he turns it off and on again."}

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "I beg your indulgence for a moment, as I step into the Way-Back Machine, and emerge on a quiet afternoon in the spring of 1986. I am working at a high-end audio store, and on this particular day I find myself perusing the most recent issue of The Absolute Sound. Therein, I find a rave review of the Audio Research D-115 Mk II power amplifier by veteran contributor Andrew G. Benjamin. Our store is a top-ten Audio Research dealer, so I am naturally pleased that AGB's effusive enthusiasm and insightful delineation of the D-115's merits will fuel further interest in our premier line of tube electronics. However, I feel some consternation at the magnitude of AGB's praise, especially his unequivocal proclamation that, “Perhaps if I heard a better device, I would catch some faults here or there.” I think to myself, “Well, I guess he hasn't heard the Audio Research M-100s.” I know from personal experience that, while the D-115 is indeed a sensational $3000 stereo amplifier, the $5000 per pair Audio Research M-100 mono amplifiers are even better still.\nThis little anecdote kept popping into my head as I contemplated how to present the results of four years' worth of comparative listening tests, covering eight different sound cards. While I haven't heard every sound card out there, I sure have spent a good deal of “quality time” testing many of the prime contenders.\nI can happily report that long-term evaluation of another half-dozen sound cards has only confirmed the validity of those first impressions. While the performance of USB, FireWire, and network-streaming devices continues to evolve and improve, the design of internal PCI audio interfaces is already a mature science, based on established engineering standards and robust, proven technologies. The best sound cards set a benchmark standard against which alternative technologies must ultimately be judged.\nAs most readers of The Absolute Sound have discovered, every new listening experience adds to our accumulated knowledge base. Over the course of this survey, the process of auditioning each successive product added further perspective and context, ultimately culminating in a surprising and exciting conclusion.\nAfter my initial tests of the analog outputs of the Echo Mia MIDI and Gina 3G, I turned to their digital outputs, driving my Bryston BDA-1 digital-to-analog converter. Despite my preconceptions favoring the digital connectivity architecture of the Gina 3G, I was surprised to find that the digital output of the Mia MIDI actually sounded better, with a more incisive, open, and rhythmically agile presentation. While the analog outputs of both Echo cards sounded fine at their respective price points, the Bryston DAC is in an entirely different league, as has been described in these pages in Issues 193 and 194.\nSince both Echo cards are limited to a maximum sample rate of 96kHz, I moved on to products that support all the common sample rates up to 192kHz. First up was the M-Audio Audiophile 192 ($200), which features RCA digital S/PDIF jacks on its mounting bracket, and balanced analog outputs on quarter-inch TRS phono jacks at the end of a short DSUB breakout cable. I auditioned the Audiophile 192's analog outputs only briefly, finding trade-offs versus the Echo Gina 3G. The Audiophile 192 exhibited a slightly washed-out character, rendering music with a desaturated tonal palette compared to the Gina 3G's more substantial and colorful presentation.\nIn contrast, the digital output of the M-Audio Audiophile 192 handily outperformed those of both Echo cards. I won't bother listing all the areas in which sound quality improved, since the bottom line was simply this: You name it, and it got better. The net effect was a wholesale increase in both sonic realism and musical communicativeness. However, as I continued to use the Audiophile 192 for many months, I ran into a few problems. Its driver was more temperamental than that of the Echo cards, occasionally freezing up and requiring a computer reboot. It was also subject to occasional dropouts, which I rarely encountered with the other cards tested. Finally, the Audiophile 192 was not capable of transmitting a 176.4kHz signal via its digital output; rather, it downconverted this sample rate to 88.2kHz.\nThe next contender proved to be quite a delight, with some unique, appealing features. The $139 ESI Maya44's RCA digital S/PDIF output jack is also optimally located on the card's mounting bracket, accompanied by an optical TosLink S/PDIF jack. Two pairs of single-ended analog inputs and outputs are efficiently configured on stereo quarter-inch TRS phono jacks. The output stage of the second analog output pair (channels 3 and 4) features a very low source impedance that can drive headphones directly. In use, the Maya44 operated with rock-solid stability, but unfortunately also downconverted 176.4kHz signals to 88.2kHz via its digital output.\nThe Maya44's coaxial S/PDIF digital output delivered a light, airy sound via the Bryston DAC. Its character was rather impressionistic, lacking a bit of body, foundation, and tonal richness. Direct comparison with the M-Audio Audiophile 192 clearly favored the Maya44, which delineated instrumental lines with greater ease, and allowed music to flow and breathe with a compellingly engaging naturalness. The Audiophile 192 sounded more forward, with a weightier bass range, but the Maya44 rendered the sounds of actual instruments playing in the lower octaves with superior pitch definition, rhythmic subtlety, and dynamic inflection.\nThe intrinsic sonic character of the Maya44's analog outputs paralleled that of its digital output, a theme that was consistently repeated across the span of this survey. The Maya44's second analog output pair was the better of the two, with punchier, tighter bass and superior focus. Sonic artifacts such as slight grain, a bit of edginess on transient peaks, and diminished soundfield scale were clearly evident when compared against the far more capable Bryston DAC, but these colorations were so astutely balanced that they never interfered with the Maya44's ability to play music with a lively sense of involvement. Setting the Maya44's analog-domain output-level control to -2dB reduced the sharpness on high-level peaks to an appreciable degree. All told, the Maya44 once again raised the bar another notch closer to the elusive goal of sonic realism.\nMoving on to the feature-rich RME Hammerfall HDSP-9632 ($549), I was finally rewarded with a sound card that could transmit all sample rates including 176.4kHz via both coaxial S/PDIF and balanced AES/EBU digital outputs. Alas, I immediately ran into a snag due to the manner in which Foobar 2000 interacts with RME's ASIO Hammerfall DSP driver to assign ASIO channels to the card's physical outputs. This problem threatened to require manually switching between three different ASIO configurations depending on the sample rate of the file being played—clearly an untenable situation.\nFortunately, the freeware utility ASIO4ALL came to the rescue, since it can limit the number of ASIO channels visible to the music playback program. With ASIO4ALL, a single Foobar ASIO channel assignment configuration enabled the HDSP-9632 to play files of any sample rate without incident. Both the RME ASIO driver and the universal ASIO4ALL driver bypass the Windows audio subsystem to deliver a bit-accurate signal to the sound card hardware, and I heard no audible difference between the two options.\nI also tested another music playback program, Media Monkey, which assigns ASIO channels in an entirely different manner. Media Monkey was able to use RME's native ASIO Hammerfall DSP driver to play files of all sample rates via either the HDSP-9632's stereo analog or digital outputs without any problem whatsoever.\nWhen I began assessing the RME card's S/PDIF output, my reactions were mixed. The RME sounded clean and full, in a forthright and controlled manner, but also exhibited a closed-in, muted quality that lacked the beguiling ebullience of the Maya44. However, as I revisited familiar source material, I found myself able to hear deeper into the music via the RME, discerning musical strands that the Maya44 left buried in the mix.\nI did a quick Wikipedia search, and found pavane defined as “a slow processional dance that enjoyed great popularity in the courts of Europe during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.” While this piece sounded lovely via the Maya44, the RME card presented it in an entirely different, revelatory (or perhaps Ravelatory) light, clarifying the meaning and structure of the music with obvious, manifestly superior lucidity. Even more significantly, it made clear that Skrowaczewski's interpretation of the work masterfully conveyed the composition's essence, and that both the original recording and the subsequent digital transfer successfully preserved the expressive dynamic shadings and timing cues of that performance.\nThe RME card's AES/EBU digital output didn't fare as well, sounding brighter and more mechanical, with an electronic haze that diminished the magical rhythmic dexterity so evident via coaxial S/PDIF. My initial impression of a mellow, midrange-centric, overly restrained character was confirmed and amplified when I auditioned the RME card's analog outputs, which reminded me of a vintage Linn Sondek turntable in both virtues and liabilities: musically expressive, yet colored by excess warmth, curiously curtailed reverberant decays, and an intimate, close-up perspective that flattered recordings of small ensembles, but never opened up enough to convey the power and impact of a full orchestra.\nAfter my positive experience with ESI's Maya44, I approached the oddly named ESI Juli@ card ($199) with eager anticipation. The Juli@ card features a clever analog input/output configuration, with a reversible plug-in board that is fitted with RCA jacks on one side, and balanced TRS jacks on the other. Alas, I was disappointed to find the coaxial S/PDIF RCA jacks relegated to thin breakout cables tenuously connected to the card by a loose-fitting multi-pin DIN plug.\nDespite my concern about this less-than-ideal digital output configuration, the Juli@ immediately distinguished itself as something quite special driving the Bryston BDA-1 DAC. Rather than the Maya44's euphonic, water-color presentation, the Juli@ illuminated the music with unprecedented clarity, focus, and resolution. Rather than the RME's restrained, closed-down character, the Juli@ breathed with life, air, and energy. The Juli@ card rendered complex timbres effortlessly, with an unsurpassed ability to convey note shape—the dynamic and harmonic growth and decay of each note over time.\nSpatial cues were presented with captivating verisimilitude. Finally, here was a card that preserved the full scale of well-recorded orchestral performances, with three-dimensional instrumental body and natural reverberant decay into the ambient air of the recording venue. Of particular note was the Juli@'s imperturbable dynamic stability. Even during energetic crescendos, the Juli@ card maintained a consistent perspective; instruments in the rear of the soundfield stayed in the rear of the soundfield. In contrast, every other sound card in this survey exhibited sonic artifacts during high-energy peaks, either coarsening textures, adding glare, or projecting the sound forward.\nThis sense of unflustered, well-behaved equanimity categorically differentiated the ESI Juli@ from every other sound card tested. Whether delicate chamber music, free-wheeling improvisational jazz, or raucous rock ’n’ roll, the Juli@ not only reproduced the recorded sound in a manifestly realistic manner, it played the music with expressive subtlety and enthralling vitality.\nAfter hearing the standard-setting performance of the Juli@'s digital output, I crossed my fingers as I connected its RCA analog outputs to my preamp. My hopes were rewarded, as the sound of the analog outputs mirrored the considerable merits of the card's digital output. No, the Juli@ card's analog outputs did not deliver the soundstage width and depth, unfettered dynamic peaks, rich tonal complexity, and rhythmic precision of the Bryston DAC, but the essence of the presentation was uncannily preserved, only on a smaller, less resolved scale. The Juli@'s cardinal virtues remained obvious via the RCA analog outputs, diminished in degree, but not in character. Even after periods of extended listening, I found myself shaking my head in disbelief, admitting to myself that “I could live with this,” so well-balanced were the sonic compromises of the Juli@'s RCA analog outputs. However, I was utterly chagrined to find that the Juli@'s balanced TRS analog outputs sounded comparatively shrill, unrefined, and fatiguing. I sighed with relief after reversing the Juli@'s analog output board again, returning to the sweet, even-tempered music flowing forth from its single-ended RCA analog outputs.\nThe final two sound cards arrived courtesy of well-respected Lynx Studio Technology. The L-22 ($749) is a stereo card capable of internal decoding of all sample rates up to 192kHz for playback via its analog outputs, but limited to a maximum of 96kHz via its AES/EBU digital output. The AES-16 ($695) is a versatile multichannel digital-only card with comprehensive onboard mixing capabilities. All inputs and outputs on both cards are provided on DSUB connectors.\nThe L-22's balanced analog outputs delivered a visceral, full-bodied presentation, rich with tactile immediacy. However, under dynamic conditions, it failed to measure up to the ESI Juli@'s poise and composure. At low to moderate signal levels, the L-22 exhibited a smooth liquidity, but high-level peaks sounded edgy and forward. It offered a vivid, up-front perspective, but with reduced depth, flattened dimensionality, and truncated reverberant decays. The L-22 seemed to emphasize whatever was most prominent in the mix, spotlighting the loudest element of the music with explicit directness and presence, but at the expense of overshadowing quieter instruments playing simultaneously. The L-22's AES/EBU digital outputs sounded remarkably consistent with its analog outputs. Considered on its own, the L-22 certainly sounded nice enough, but repeated comparisons only emphasized its colorations when compared against the more coherent, neutral, better-behaved ESI Juli@.\nThe Lynx AES-16's AES/EBU digital outputs exhibited an obvious family resemblance to those of the L-22, but with superior performance across the board. Compared to the L-22, the AES-16 sounded cleaner, with improved solidity, tighter focus, reduced temporal smearing, and a more engaging sense of drive. Substituting upgraded AES/EBU cables improved performance even further. Still, direct comparison with the ESI Juli@ laid bare the AES-16's limitations: lackluster rhythmic alacrity, homogenized tonal colors, and a subtle opacity that obscured note decay, hall ambience, and low-level dynamic inflections in a manner analogous to the absorption of sound in humid air. Perhaps I might have had a more enthusiastic reaction to the Lynx cards had I auditioned them earlier, but after hearing the extraordinary ESI Juli@, it became abundantly clear just how much of the music the Lynx cards were missing.\nThe computer used for these tests is quite ordinary, a nine-year-old PC with a 1.47GHz AMD processor, 1 GB of RAM, and no geeky tweaking of arcane operational parameters. The machine is utterly representative of a stock generic PC, other than having been fitted with a quieter power supply and fan-speed regulators to reduce mechanical noise. Thus, the conclusions drawn from these tests can confidently be expected to represent what anyone can achieve with minimal effort.\nFor consistency over the course of this project, I have continued to use the Windows XP operating system. I encountered no problems installing any of the cards or their software drivers, even with two or three cards installed simultaneously. All of the cards can utilize the professional standard ASIO protocol that bypasses the Windows audio subsystem, thereby insuring bit-perfect signal transfer and playback of music files at their native sample rates. I set ASIO latency to 512 samples in each card's on-screen control panel, which allowed playback of all supported sample rates without drop-outs or audible glitches. I used the program Foobar 2000 for playback and library management. Mac Pro users are advised to choose a music player that circumvents the limitations of Apple's CoreAudio architecture, such as Decibel, Pure Music, or Amarra.\nDue to limited physical space, most sound cards use non-standard connectors for analog and digital inputs and outputs, such as multi-pin DSUB or DIN jacks. In such cases, the cards are usually supplied with either short breakout cables fitted with RCA or XLR jacks, or cables of modest-length (typically 6 feet) that can be attached directly to nearby audio components. Unfortunately, these stock cables are often of the “included with a cheap VCR” caliber. Substitution of higher-quality after-market cables offers the potential of further improving performance, as with any critical analog or digital source component. I auditioned each sound card with the cables provided by the manufacturer, and also tested custom upgraded cables wherever possible."}

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "Will the universe expand forever, or will it one day collapse under the influence of its own gravity? Few questions can at once be more imminent, yet more distant. Arguably, the more important question for how spacefaring communities conduct themselves in the interim grace period is not will there actually be a collapse, but who believes that one is coming, and when.\nPrediction markets generally buy and sell shares on the outcome of binary yes-no queries set in the not-to-distant future. A recent paper simply titled, ‘The End‘, that has been incubating over on the Arxiv preprint server has just been promoted to peer-publication status in Physical Review Letters. In it the authors wager the ultimate prediction: Not only will there be an Armageddon, but the collapse of the universe will start to kick in a few tens of billions of years from today.\nAs author Tony Padilla explains in the video below, the question hinges in part on the value of the cosmological constant. Einstein first introduced the constant to square his theory of general relativity with the prevailing conception of a static universe. Einstein later withdrew support for the constant, because Hubble’s subsequent discovery that distant galaxies were all moving away from each other implied an expanding universe. More recent discoveries, however, now suggest that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. In other words, observations of cosmic background radiation, together with the large red shift of distant galaxies, force us to conclude that the universe is 70% vested in “dark energy”.\nThe cosmological constant is the simplest form that dark energy can take — a vacuum energy that is constant across both time and space. What Padilla showed, together with his colleague Nemanja Kalope, was that if certain reasonable assumptions are made, then the currently observed epoch of accelerated expansion provides sufficient evidence of impending collapse. This may come as a bit of a disappointment for those who may have been prepping for the protracted heat death of an open universe. A big crunch would place severe restrictions on how long the information we manage to store today can persist, something other researchers have been puzzling over recently.\nNot everyone is convinced of all this just yet. The results, like many generated in cosmology today, depend on specific reformulations of Einstein’s equations of general relativity. They also presume that the universe is just 13.8 billion years old. Sharp-eyed readers may note that only the ‘observable’ universe is actually known to be 13.8 BYO. Beyond that, all bets are off. If there are profits to be made from either collapse or expansion, we might expect the central preoccupation of future civilizations to be that of thinkfluencing the fate of our universe.\nIf, by creative manipulation of mass and energy, future civilizations can manage to arrange things so that some part of the universe might survive collapse, things could get very interesting. Right now, over at Predictious.com you can still buy shares at $7 apiece that Moon Express will win the Google Lunar X-prize.\nIt is probably obvious to seasoned investors that markets like these are all still quite immature. Peddling knowledge of doom, whether it be, say, collapse of a particular ice shelf, or that of the universe itself, appears more acceptable to us when it only affects our own pocket. Peddling optimism and survival, on the other hand, on the open market may prove to be our answer."}

J2EE 1.4 is supported on the platform, which plugs in to the Eclipse open source IDE.\nVendors can use Web Tools Platform 1.0 as a base offering on which to add value for commercial purposes. BEA plans to implement the Web Tools Platform in its BEA Workshop development platform and equip it with functionality such as facilities for using for the Apache Beehive programming model and extended support for the BEA WebLogic Server application server.\nThe Web Services Explorer tool featured in Web Tools Platform 1.0 is a browser-based application allowing for discovery and invocation of Web services from within the platform. \"It allows you to, for example, go out to discover a WSDL or Web service that's available on the Web and begin interacting with it directly,\" Wagner said. An example could be an Amazon Web service geared toward the Amazon product catalog; users would not have to write any code to get to the Web service.\nAlso featured are Java and WSDL code generation wizards that generate the portion of an application that accesses the Web service. Version 1.0 also has tools to configure and monitor servers and support debugging based on Java Specification Request 45.\nThe Web Tools Platform benefits both Eclipse and BEA, said Shawn Willett, principal analyst at Current Analysis. \"It's definitely good news for BEA because while Workshop was a good tool, they need to put it on a standards basis. People are moving to Eclipse, and they needed to move with it,\" Willett said.\nEclipse gets enhanced functionality via the Web tools project, said Willett. \"A Web development tool is in pretty high demand,\" and is something Eclipse needs, Willett said.\nWeb Tools Platform 1.0 features no direct support for Microsoft's .Net platform, although developers could use the tools within the platform to develop .Net support, Wagner said.\nCallisto, to be officially known as Eclipse Platform 3.2, will feature a follow-up release of Web Tools Platform that features J2EE 1.5 tooling, including support for Java annotations, which allows for embedding of comments directly into code.\nOther Eclipse offerings to be featured in Callisto include tools from the Data Tools Platform, Test & Performance Tools Platform, and Business Intelligence and Reporting Tools projects. The Eclipse IDE will be included as well.\nThe consolidated release of Eclipse technology is driven by efficiency. Users get all the technologies at once, and they will work together. \"It will end the discovery problem\" pertaining to Eclipse technologies by providing multiple offerings in one download, Wagner said. Commercial companies will be able to build products on top of Callisto.\nCallisto is a natural evolution of the Eclipse platform, Willett said. \"They're getting a lot more granular in terms of what Eclipse covers,\" he said."}

Wild Child: Rewilding Childhood – enough.\nOver the last few months, I’ve been working with We Are Wildness (an organization dedicated to helping people reconnect with Nature) on developing a program to encourage people to take their children outside. We’ve titled it “Wild Child: Rewilding Childhood,” and I’m pretty excited about putting it out into the world. On one hand, it seems a dichotomy — a program designed to get kids outside that is…virtual? Well, yes. As much as I don’t like to acquiesce to technology, the fact is that ‘being online’ is part of life as we know it right now. So the hope is that by developing an online program, we’ll be reaching people who maybe wouldn’t normally just choose to visit the local nature center. Or the parents who remember fondly their youthful adventures outdoors, but notice their offspring looking at an iPad more often than the sky while swinging from backyard tree branches. Or the families that love getting outside, but tend to let other things take priority. And anyone else who wants ideas and support in doing things differently. The list could go on. But however we reach whoever we reach, I’m excited to be part of the movement to rewild childhood.\nIf you grew up in the 1980s or before, it’s likely you spent much of your free time during childhood running around outside, making forts, chasing butterflies or just kicking around with the neighborhood kids. You didn’t have a cell phone and the video game options were limited. Going outside was the best option. We think it still is, and according to ample research, going outside is essential for optimal cognitive and physical development. Kids learn how to adapt to change, overcome challenges, and take healthy risks. They learn courage, build autonomy and exercise creativity. They figure out what it means to be a part of a community that is bigger than what they can see on a screen and are more likely to develop a sense of responsibility to the Earth itself due to being in direct relationship with the natural world. They intimately learn about the nature that is closest to home and have the opportunity to develop a love and appreciation of protecting what they see as part of them.\nMaybe you’ll hike a trail, maybe you’ll run through a grassy field, maybe you’ll go to the beach. Maybe you’ll go on a wilderness vacation, but maybe, and perhaps this is even more essential than a deep wilderness experience, you and your little ones will just sit in the front yard and watch the clouds go by. The objective of this challenge is to make spending time outside part of the norm-part of what is essential for the days of the children in your care. We think you might be surprised at what you learn about the earth and yourself along the way.\nWill you join the movement to rewild childhood?\nFor full program details and to join the challenge, visit learn.wearewildness.com."}

These are just a sample, but there is clearly an appetite for reform across the country and we need to begin to seed the sense that change can happen in victories across the country. And we need to find places where each change can build on the last, whether it is a change to how campaigns are financed, or how people vote.\nGuiding membership organizations to engage in democracy reform: We know one of the key challenges for DI member organizations – and for the democracy movement broadly – is to how to connect with and mobilize millions of our members and activists in the fight to give true meaning to the promise of our democracy. The DI’s messaging project is focused precisely on meeting that challenge. We will be developing specific communications tools and materials for DI partners and to both sound the alarm on the attacks on our democracy and champion meaningful solutions to the threats imperiling our democracy.\nThe Convening made clear that these three outcomes are essential for the Democracy Initiative’s continued growth and success. We will share more detailed plans shortly for our work together in 2015 and 2016. We enthusiastically welcome your feedback and ideas. Please contact Marissa Brown (mbrown@democracyinitiative.org) with any thoughts or suggestions.\nJanuary 21st, 2015 marked the 5th anniversary of the Supreme Court’s disastrous Citizens United decision, unleashing a massive onslaught of corporate and mega-wealthy donor money on our political system. As our first national day of action of the year, Democracy Initiative partners and allies coordinated multiple activities and events to fire up activists and educate the public at large about the devastating consequences of this decision.\nThere were more than 60 events in 50 cities and towns across the country, with thousands demonstrating nationwide on a cold winter day. The flagship event in front of the Chamber of Commerce in Washington, DC gathered a large crowd of activists and supporters. Present at the event were Common Cause, Sierra Club, NAACP, Greenpeace USA, CWA, Public Campaign, Every Voice, ATU, APWU, Public Citizen, People for the American Way, US PIRG, Jobs With Justice, Free Speech for People, and Alliance for Justice.\nMore than five million petition signatures were gathered in support of a constitutional amendment to overturn the decision. 22 Democracy Initiative partners contributed to this petition drive.\nOp-eds from 47 leaders were featured across the country targeting Citizens United and its adverse effects on our democracy, including 12 from Democracy Initiative partners. The Center for Environmental Health, CWA, Common Cause, NAACP, Public Citizen, People for the American Way, and US PIRG featured prominently in national and local publications such as Alaska Dispatch News, Delaware County Times, Des Moines Register, The Hill, Huffington Post (and here, here, and here), Kansas City Star, The Monitor, Dallas Star-Telegram, Talking Points Memo, and the Texas Tribune.\nOn January 14th, eight organizations came together for a joint research release event entitled, Five Years After Citizens United: What are the Costs to Democracy? Independent research on the role of money in the 2014 midterm elections was presented by the Center for Media and Democracy, Common Cause, Demos and US PIRG, Justice at Stake, Public Campaign, Public Citizen, and the Brennan Center, with particular emphasis on the effects of 2010’s Citizens United v. FEC.\nAfter months of planning, all of this work demonstrated the power of our coalition and activists, collectively fighting back as billionaires and corporations continue to buy our government at the expense of hardworking Americans.\nOn December 11th and 12th, the Democracy Initiative hosted its third annual convening, bringing together more than 200 leaders and activists from many diverse organizations and advocacy backgrounds for a discussion and opportunity to collaborate on some of the most important issues facing our democracy today. It was the biggest convening by far, and the room remained packed when the conference concluded on its second day.\nLaunching the two-day conference was a collaborative meeting with the leaders of DI organizations. With a warm welcome by CWA President Larry Cohen and Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune, Democracy Initiative Executive Director Marissa Brown and Common Cause President Miles Rapoport led a discussion on what has been accomplished to date and the potential strategic directions for Democracy Initiative and choices about potential campaigns and priorities. As noted, this was the largest gathering of organizational leaders since DI’s founding and provided a great opportunity for face-to-face discussion to set priorities and how organizations can use their strengths and infrastructure to advance a democracy agenda in the coming year and beyond.\nAs this meeting of “principals” concluded, the second and longer part of the conference was kicked off with a dynamic joint speech by Greenpeace USA’s new Executive Director, Annie Leonard, and the NAACP’s new President & CEO, Cornell William Brooks (below left). Together, they synthesized the guidance from the morning leaders meeting and set the stage on what to expect at the Convening.\nWendy Weiser (above right), Brennan Center’s Democracy Program Director, then took the stage for a presentation on the lay of the land for advancing a democracy agenda. Addressing the advance of restrictive voting laws passed since 2010, she then outlined a defensive and affirmative agenda for both protecting and expanding voting rights.\nThe Road to a Constitutional Amendment – A discussion on how the amendment campaign can take further steps forward in the next two years and how it can positively impact other organizing efforts.\nAdvancing Voting Rights – A discussion on expanding voting rights, modernizing state voting systems, and restoring felon voting rights.\nBig Money Tips the Scales of Justice – How judicial elections undermining the independence of our state courts.\nMany Voices, One Chorus – This was a presentation by Lake Research’s Senior Partner, David Mermin, on the Democracy Initiative’s ongoing large-scale polling and research project. Aimed at developing umbrella message materials for DI organizations on democracy, David provided an update on what we have learned so far through the first focus groups and what organizations can expect in the months ahead.\nRight: Jodeen Olguin-Tayler of Demos.\nThe conference reconvened for a presentation and panel discussion on the new Stacked Deck Report led by Demos Counsel Adam Lioz, and Director of Advocacy Jodeen Olguin-Tayler. Their passionate presentations on how a political agenda driven by the donor class exacerbates economic and racial inequities and undermine the fundamental principles of our democracy were truly moving and underscored the importance of democratic reform.\nThink Nationally, Act Locally – Focused on working locality by locality to build for public financing systems that empower small donors.\nFighting back in the States – Highlighted recent campaigns and explore state-level opportunities for efforts to protect and even increase access to the polls.\nMobilizing Millions – Strategized about how to seize opportunities for collective engagement in 2015 in the money in politics and voting rights fields nationally and in states.\nRedistricting – Focus on reforms that will create districts drawn to reflect community interests.\nLifting the Corporate Veil – How we will win fights to force disclosure of corporate political and lobbying spending.\nMoving Forward on Voting Rights Step by Step – Building campaigns in states to move same-day registration.\nBreakout sessions during both days of the conference.\nThe conference concluded with a packed house as Greg Moore, the Democracy Initiative’s Senior Strategist, and Courtney Hight, the Sierra Club’s Democracy Program Director, led a collaborative discussion and debrief session on the Democracy Initiative’s next steps. Leaders and participants alike described the inspiration they drew from the conference, noting the impressive breadth of our coalition and the clarity that was present in developing a broad program to enact the changes that will make our government of, by, and for the people.\nThank you for tuning in to this edition of the DI Report.

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "I was in the 5th grade when I came to the realization that Santa Claus was not real. Even in 1973, eleven years old was ancient in terms of believing in Old Saint Nick. But why should I not believe? Every year I wrote a letter to Santa, and the presents appeared. Maybe not exactly what I asked for, but close enough to keep me believing. My mother taught me that Santa was a real person who knew who was naughty and who was nice. When I came home from school telling her that classmates had become unbelievers, she acted appalled, and assured me that those who stopped believing would no longer receive his gifts on Christmas morning. Believing that Santa Claus was real gave me a sense of joy - a magical being cared so much about me that he gave me gifts! So it came as quite a shock when my younger sister outed my parents for lying to me all the eleven years I had spent on this earth. I was played the fool. A seismic jolt had altered my worldview. I didn’t want to stop believing, but when presented with the observations, evidence and rational facts which demonstrated that Santa Claus could not possibly exist, I had no choice but to face a reality without him.\nThe entire premise of the Christian faith is based upon belief in a singular event: The bodily resurrection of Jesus from the dead. I never completely understood the “rose on the third day” thing, since a simple calculation from the gospels shows it was less than 39 hours. Nevertheless, in order to receive the gift of everlasting life, one must choose to believe in this event. A person must choose to believe in this event with the same mind that decides to not believe that the earth is supported on the shoulders of a primordial Titan named Atlas, or that lightning bolts are thrown down from Mount Olympus by Zeus, or that the Book of Mormon was translated by Joseph Smith from divine gold plates with the help of an angel named Moroni.\nWe are taught that the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John were divinely inspired and written in order that the generations of humans that would follow, for centuries and millennia, would benefit from the observations of the original followers of Jesus. More specifically, that these followers observed the event: the resurrected Jesus. We are to choose to believe in the event because in A.D. 367, the Bishop of Alexandria “canonized” the Gospels into the 27-book New Testament. Yet, in these divinely generated and preserved writings, the observations recorded by the original witnesses are enough to conclude that the event was at best a misunderstanding, and at worst a fraud.\n1) In the Gospel of John, at the tomb on Sunday morning, Mary Magdalene first encounters angels, then encounters a man who she presumes is a gardener. She has a conversation with this man, asking him where he took the body of Jesus. The man reveals himself to be Jesus. Are we to believe that Mary, who sat at the feet of Jesus, hanging on to every word he spoke, who cured her from seven demons, could not recognize him after only 39 hours?\n2) In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus appears to his eleven disciples, but some doubt that it is truly Jesus. Such doubt, after spending every waken moment with him for the last three years – when not three full days had past when they had broken bread with him?\n3) In the Gospel of Luke, on the road to Emmaus, Jesus appears to two disciples. I have heard commentaries that the journey was seven miles and that the conversation Jesus has with the two was approximately two hours long. Yet the two did not recognize that this was Jesus. It isn’t until the man revealed that he was indeed Jesus that they believed.\nI conclude that the original followers of Jesus wanted to believe so badly that Jesus resurrected from the dead that they believed an impostor.According to the Bible, Jesus took his last breath at around 3:00 PM on a Friday. He was found resurrected by 6:00 AM on Sunday. This was 39 hours later. After being beaten and crucified, he had to look like hell - if you’ll pardon the expression. I’m talking scars, bruises, and open wounds. It never states that the body of the resurrected Jesus exhibited all these scars. Are we to believe that all these scars miraculously healed, except for the holes in his hands and side – which he kept for nostalgia sake? Observation, of the very testimony meant to substantiate belief in the resurrection, condemns it. In order to believe, one must add conditions and assumptions to the Bible – yet the Apostle John warns against adding anything to this book in his Revelation.\nI conclude that the original followers of Jesus wanted to believe so badly that Jesus resurrected from the dead that they believed an impostor. Further, I will render a guess that Mary Magdalene had something to do with arranging the impostor. I will leave the details of that theory to a future post. With this Impostor Theory, it’s important to note that the resurrected Jesus became pissed off, so to speak, when his disciples did not recognize him right away, or did not believe he had risen from the dead when others reported it. This just reeks of a deceptive cult leader using anger as a tool for power and control. It’s a well-documented characteristic of cult leaders to frighten followers with social-psychological influence, and anger plays a monumental part of their character composition.\nKnowing that Jesus resurrected from the dead gave me a sense of joy - he loved me enough to die for me, giving me the gift of everlasting life. But observations from the Bible itself reveal that the resurrection story, something I have believed most of my 50 years I have spent on this earth, is a lie. I was played the fool. A seismic jolt has now altered my worldview. I didn’t want to stop believing, but after finally coming to terms with observation, evidence, and the rational facts which demonstrate that Jesus could not have possibly resurrected from the dead, I had no choice but to face a reality without him."}

Sokt Plumbing offers a 24-hour, seven days a week, Tulsa Toilet Repair service to get your bathroom running in proper order.\nSokt’s certified technicians are experts in installation and repair services to all kinds of toilets. We understand that having a leaking toilet is something no one wants to deal with. This is why we offer a 24/7 emergency plumbing service to get this problem solved as quickly as possible. No matter the type of toilet, or the cause of the leak, we will fix it in a timely manner.\nLeaking Supply Line – A faulty supply line will cause the toilet to leak as joints in the supply line become loose or wear out. Typically, a rubber lining is used to guard against leakage but may wear out or rupture. Mechanical damage to the supply line can also cause leaking.\nStuck Flapper – A stuck flapper can cause huge amounts of water loss. Usually, this is caused by the flush handle getting stuck in the down position. While stuck, the fill valve continues to supply the toilet tank with water, leading to massive overflow.\nWarped Flapper – With age, the flapper will get worn out with mineral build up. Water authorities constantly add chemicals to the water to purify it, which subsequently causes the flapper to gradually wear away. Water loss is dependent on the extent to which the flapper is worn out.\nFaulty Fill Valve – Like the Flapper, it wears down with time and the accumulation of mineral deposits and becomes less effective. In certain occasions it may fail to shut off completely, leading to a toilet leak.\nFaulty Float – The float is a hollow ball that floats on the water surface in the tank. When cracked or improperly aligned, it causes the fill valve to run continuously, causing a leak.\nOne of the many great services provided by Sokt Plumbing, is that our service technicians are supported with vehicles that are stocked with supplies and equipment that are required to fix most plumbing problems on the spot, no matter the time. We are the top 24/7 emergency Tulsa Toilet Repair service.\nOur goal is to assist you by solving your plumbing issues efficiently, so that you are able to work or relax at home without any significant delay.

The ICS (International Chili Society) helps to monitor and judge cook-offs (with profits going to charity) all over the world. Chili judges from the ICS are called, as you could probably guess, Chiliheads.\n• For the Record: chili-eating contest won by Richard LeFevre consisted of 1.5 gallons of chili consumed in 10 minutes (kids, don’t try this at home).\n• I feel like this is the second example of someone who tragically perished after eating a super-hot chili sauce (although last time was it tabasco?), but if you ever plan on engaging in such crazed behavior, you may first want to ready why it is that only some people are able to eat hot foods (hint: they are likely desensitized to it!).\n• Chili peppers that are always safe for consumption? (well, except for the album cover of Stadium Arcadium), The Red Hot Chili Peppers originally called themselves Tony Flow & the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem.\n• Bill Cosby, being a frequent visitor, was even awarded the distinction of a sign at the counter that reads: “List of who eats free at Ben’s: Bill Cosby. No one else” (although the Obamas were later added to that list).\n• So how many of you have cooked for (and won?) a chili cook-off, what’s that special ingredient to making a fantastic chili, and does anyone know of some tasty vegetarian chili I can find while I’m up here in Chicago this week?"}

The first step was to apply a brake setup that utilized the factory calipers along with an upgraded rotor and pad.

The last would give her status and a $100,000-plus paycheck.\nSince joining Arthur Andersen three years ago after earning an undergraduate business degree at the University of Illinois, the Downstate native has worked for a range of clients, typically spending months at a time immersed in the business of each.\nThough she lives and works in the Chicago area, she goes wherever the client is and thrives on the variety of work.\n\"It's like I'm a member of an intellectual SWAT team. I enjoy the mix,\" she says.\nOne satisfying assignment: A large non-profit organization needed to hone its customer focus.

She is preparing to compete in a 5K race against domestic violence that Andersen helps sponsor.\nMs. Ulbrich says she wants to stay in Chicago -- she found New York a bit much on a recent business trip. Her only complaint concerns something even the best economic planning in Chicago can't do anything about: the weather.\nAlthough the Chicago region has lost more than a few corporate heavyweights to takeovers, it still has its success stories.\nThirteen companies, including Walgreen Co., Abbott Laboratories, Illinois Tool Works Inc. and Aon Corp., outperformed the S&P 500's total return to shareholders -- 193.8% -- for the five years ended last December.\nNear the top of the list is Walgreen, with a return of more than 500%. The powerhouse retailer, which this year has been opening a new drugstore nearly every day, operates more than 2,500 locations in 36 states.\nBeyond stock market performance, several of the region's companies have displayed world-class stature.\nAlthough perennially distracted by labor strife, United Airlines parent UAL Corp. is still the world's largest air carrier. McDonald's Corp. has been testing the limits of growth but still reigns as the king of fast food.\nAndersen Consulting has emerged as the behemoth of the information technology consulting world with a global reach.\nVulture investor Sam Zell controls one of the nation's largest portfolios of commercial real estate and has led his industry into the public ownership arena with his three Chicago-based real estate investment trusts. The largest, Equity Office Properties Trust, has a market capitalization of $7.6 billion and 1,460 employees.\nAnd while many large local companies have succumbed to takeovers, some have themselves been active buyers.\nLast year, housewares company Newell Co. acquired Rubbermaid Inc. of Ohio for nearly $6 billion.\nAon Corp. Chairman Patrick Ryan has fashioned a global insurance brokerage business with a string of acquisitions, including 10 last year, mostly in Europe and Latin America.\nAon's revenues have more than doubled since 1994, while the company's total return to shareholders during that time has outpaced both the S&P 500 index and the S&P insurance brokers index.\nAnd Illinois Tool Works, a maker of industrial basics such as fasteners and paint guns, has been on an acquisition tear for the past several years, buying 24 small-to-mid-sized companies in 1997 and completing two larger deals in 1998 and 1999.\nAnalyst William Fiala with St. Louis based investment firm Edward D.

My first positions were at the Savannah College of Art & Design: There I worked in serials were I got my early cataloging chops and then I moved into the Visual Resources Center which I consider my gateway job to DAM. There I learned image cataloging for a homegrown institutional Digital Image Database. My final position at SCAD was as a reference librarian, which has served me well when it comes to instruction for the end users of the Digital Asset Library I currently manage. Now, I am a Digital Asset Archivist at Georgia State University. Here I have established and administer a DAM system for the university’s PR and Marketing Communications Division. This system serves as both archive and distribution vehicle for the PR and Marketing assets we create for the colleges, departments and programs of the university.\nHaving come from a library background I joined the Visual Resources Association while I was working at SCAD and pursuing my MLIS degree at Valdosta State University. The VRA proved very valuable when I first attended their conference in Atlanta, GA. I learned of industry trends and resources there. Many DAM vendors attended so I was exposed to a broad spectrum of DAM systems. There I learned of their Summer Educational Institute for Visual Resources and Image Management (SEI). This was an immersive week long program at the University of New Mexico covering everything from rights management to metadata and cataloging. If you have started in libraries and are looking to make the jump to DAM, this program was the vehicle that really helped me nail the interview that got me the position at GSU. I can’t recommend it enough. Currently, I participate in our local DAM Meetup, facilitated by my friend Elizabeth Keathly, where I can stay on top of industry trends and enjoy discussions with my fellow Atlanta DAM professionals.\nMy biggest mistake with DAM was possibly not understanding how challenging learning to navigate and use a new system can be for the layman. Patience with your end users will ensure the best possible buy-in for a new system implementation!\nMy biggest success to date is the establishment of our PR and MarComm Digital Asset Library here at GSU. I take pride that I took about 15,000 disorganized image assets dumped on a local server and migrated them into a highly organized DAM system where the collection has grown to over 100,000 assets to include images, video, and graphic files. What previously required end users to come to our offices and browse images on our in-house server now has 1133 active clients able to access, browse and download assets from anywhere they have an internet connection."}

US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis has publicly been a strong proponent of granting India waivers from sanctions.\nRandall G Schriver, Assistant Secretary of Defence for Asian and Pacific Security Affairs, said: “I can’t sit here and tell you today that a (CAATSA) waiver would necessarily be used. It would be a topic discussed at the highest level of our government and they would make some determination”.\n“We understand the historical India-Russia relationship. We want to have a conversation with India not on legacy, but on future. On CAATSA, Mattis did plea for an exception for India, but I can’t guarantee a waiver will be used for future purchases.\n“Russia is not a country you want to have a strategic partnership,” Schriver told a Washington audience at the Carnegie Endowment For International Peace Wednesday.\nThe CAATSA was the result of Russian behaviour, not Indian, Schriver said as he discussed Defence Secretary James Mattis’ priorities for the upcoming 2+2 India meeting in New Delhi.\n“The Congress felt the need to take action and to demonstrate not only in words and in spirit, why we think this regime’s activities are so troublesome, but to actually take concrete action to try to have a consequence and punishment for this behaviour.\n“I think most people acknowledge it (CAATSA) was a flawed legislation for the reasons that some of our partners, friends and allies themselves might end up paying a price that was not intended. So Congress was very good at working with us to create this waiver opportunity,” he said.\n“Now we have a little more flexibility for the Secretary of State, the President to make those determinations,” Schriver said, ruling out giving a guarantee that no sanctions would be imposed on India.\n“I cannot sit here today and tell you if India buys X, then the waiver will be used or it won’t be used.\n“It would be some weighing of the concerns that the acquisition creates and how that could impact a variety of things, including the future of our defence cooperation that could put limitations on it versus wanting the political space and the ability to build out the strategic partnership with India at a more rapid pace,” the Pentagon official said.\nHe said that S-400 is a system that’s particularly troubling for a lot of reasons.\n“India’s a friend, it’s a sovereign country. They’ll make their own decisions but our preference is to seek alternatives and see if we can be a partner to India in addressing those defence needs if they choose to go down that route,” he said.\nThe United States, he said, is willing to talk to India about meeting its defence requirements and alternatives.\nThere was an “impression that we are going to completely protect the India relationship, insulate India from any fallout from this legislation no matter what they do. I would say that is a bit misleading. We would still have very significant concerns if India pursued major new platforms and systems (from Russia),” he said.\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is travelling to New Delhi with Defence Secretary Mattis for the inaugural 2+2 ministerial dialogue on September 6.\nEarlier, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman were to travel to Washington to take part in the meeting with their US counterparts in July, but the US postponed the dialogue citing “unavoidable reasons”."}
{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "Last Thursday Congress passed a short-term legislative fix in an attempt to avoid a scheduled 21.2 percent cut to Medicare physician payments. The cut, which is mandated by the flawed sustainable growth rate (SGR) formula, were originally scheduled to go into effect on January 1, 2010. Congress has repeatedly delayed the cuts as it attempts to find a longer-term fix to the SGR problem.\nAs one might expect, the bill has become a “must-pass” vehicle for other important legislative priorities as well. One of these provisions is the temporary extension of the 2009 Federal Poverty Level (FPL) guidelines through the end of May. The extension of the 2009 FPL guidelines is extremely important to health centers across the country, each of which use the guidelines to formulate their sliding fee scale. The guidelines are also used by states to determine eligibility for Medicaid, so the extension will impact that program as well. It is understandably the intent of Congress to minimize any unintended consequences the proposed 2010 FPL guidelines (which would reduce the poverty level) would impose on communities with high unemployment and uninsurance rates.\nFortunately for health centers, the SGR fix may prove to be a vehicle to clarify the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) section on Medicaid Health IT Incentives. Currently, ARRA provides incentive payments for five different provider types in order to promote, adopt, and meaningfully use interoperable health information technology. These Medicaid incentives may mean that nearly $1 billion in new resources will flow to health centers. However, there remain two technical issues that require clarification in order for health centers to fully realize the original intent of the legislation. First, the legislation needs to make clear that the State Medicaid agencies can make payments directly to Health Centers; the legislation currently authorizes payments directly to providers only. Second, the legislation needs to be revised to reflect that the “PA-led” requirement for incentives to apply to PAs should not apply to health centers – which are by definition community led.\nThe Medicaid incentives provided in ARRA offer a transformational opportunity to further customize the care health centers provide in over 7,000 communities across the country. We are working to make sure the next legislative vehicle addressing the SGR fix also recognizes the importance of clarifying the Health IT provisions for health centers as well.\nNext Are You Hip to Health Reform?"}

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "Some of my favorite authors, historical or fiction, are those who knew their writings would land them in jail, their careers would be destroyed or worse. I figured these people meant what they said and they felt strongly enough about it that they wrote it anyway, knowing in advance what was going to happen to them.\nIn this political season surrounded by folks who are all too willing to say one thing and mean (or even do) another, it’s refreshing to think about people who are true to their beliefs. Anyone who is not, I would characterize as a faker or a fraud. In the free market healthcare movement, I think we will have to be increasingly on our guard for who the fakers and frauds are. They are people who could be characterized, very fairly, as opportunists. There are people that are all too willing to wear the badge of a “free marketer” or someone who is a big fan of free markets and price transparency, all the while fleecing an employer they may be working for, or not following Jay Kempton’s pillars of the Free Market Medical Association.\nI think that we have to be on guard for these folks. I think we also need to be on guard for well-intentioned efforts, like those of governments at all levels that want to mandate price transparency. We have to be very aware that these efforts, although well-intentioned, might create many more fakers and frauds. I believe that if there are mandates for price transparency, it will provide an opportunity for legislators to auction off exemptions. These opportunists will be all too happy to buy exemptions to these price mandates, particularly if it is to their advantage and it always will be.\nWe need to be on the lookout for fakers and frauds and we need to hold up and honor those who are true to what they say. Particularly those that know there are consequences and risks for having done so."}

Here in Australia there is a lot of debate going on about University and school funding…and the Government doesn’t want to put any more money towards education if they can help it! I totally agree that education needs a re-think; and more than Uni, also school education. Both have been impacted by technology, and our students need different skills and preparation, but there is so much value placed on ‘good old days’ where students focused on reading, writing and arithmetic, that it is a fine line for governments to walk. If they put radical changes into place they would probably not get elected again. We are in a time of change and it is only through our continued learning and pushing for flexibility and new ways that any real transformation will occur.\nThank you Maddy for this post! You raise several interesting points, but at the moment I’m thinking a lot about funding for universities. I think you are right and governments need to step up and reward those universities that successfully implement flexible learning. From what I’ve seen from digitalisation in schools, it will take a lot of time, money and effort to change teaching and learning, I assume the same goes for flexible learning.\nIt will take a lot of time but if we as teachers push this through and show the research to support it and even the Return of investments then maybe they will listen?\nYes, there needs to be an open dialogue between politicians, administrators, teachers and researchers and a willingness to move forward together.\nThank you Gunilla for your feedback, Faculty is a good start and then the government."}

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "Few readers will be aware of the ‘Elizabeth Linnaeus phenomenon’ today; yet over a span of almost two hundred years botanists, gardeners and scientists speculated about it. Elizabeth was the eldest daughter of the famous botanist, Carl Linné, known as Linnaeus.\nOne evening in the early 1760s, she was enjoying her father’s summer garden at Hammarby, near Uppsala, Sweden. She noticed how the “yellow … brilliant” flowers of the nasturtium appeared to gleam unexpectedly brightly in the half-light: so much so that they appeared to be emitting flashes or sparks. So confident was she in her repeated observations that she shared them with her learned, botanist father and other philosophers and in particular with the celebrated electrical expert, Johan Wilcke. The latter concluded that the scintillations could be “related to ubiquitous Electric materials”. Although she was only nineteen, Elizabeth published her findings in an article entitled “Om Indianska Krassens Blickande” (“On the twinkling of Indian Cress”). This was recorded in the Acts of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for 1762.\nAnd on its damask eyelids pour the light.\nIn the footnotes to this stanza, Darwin explains the scientific basis (as he saw it) of the influences of heat, “scintillating” light and electricity upon “vegetative realms”. This was directly influenced by Elizabeth Linnaeus and her ‘flashing flowers’.\nIn the autumn of 1793, Darwin’s poems and William Wordsworth’s newly published ‘An Evening Walk’ and ‘Descriptive Sketches’ were the subject of “a good deal of literary & critical conversation” between Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Wordsworth’s brother Christopher Wordsworth, and their university friends at Cambridge. It was thus by means of Darwin’s poems that Elizabeth Linnaeus’ observations reached the pioneers of English Romanticism. Botany and Natural History had both a scientific and homely appeal to Wordsworth and Coleridge, because they could be enjoyed by all – men, women and children alike. Yellow and gold flowers would never seem quite the same again, having acquired mysterious qualities of vitality, light and electricity. Likewise light was now associated with electricity and took on a special significance for them, sometimes symbolic of Love, as in Wordsworth’s ‘Among all lovely things my love had been’ (also called ‘The Glow-worm’) of 1802 and Coleridge’s ‘A Day Dream’, stanza 3, of the same year.\nShoots rapid thro’ the frame!\nColeridge appended an end note to the poem which he reproduced substantially from Darwin’s Supplement to The Loves about the flashing flower. Clearly, Coleridge was drawing on the electric effect described in Elizabeth Linnaeus’ article of 1762.\nI miss the sun in heaven, having been on a short allowance of sunbeams these last ten days; and if the nervous fluid be the galvanic fluid, and the galvanic fluid the electric fluid, and the electric fluid condensed light, zounds! What an effect must these vile, dark, rainy clouds have on a poor nervous fellow, whose brain has been in a state of high illumination for the last fifteen months!\nNot only did the flowers “flash” but “Out-did the sparkling waves in glee”. These golden, flashing and dancing flowers, recorded also as “ever glancing” in Dorothy’s journal entry, appear to have been derived directly from Elizabeth Linnaeus’s description of her “yellow … brilliant” nasturtiums as “blickande” (glancing or twinkling) and possibly affected by electricity.\nElizabeth Linnaeus also “consider[ed] for a while that this [flash] might derive from a positioning of the eyes” rather than from electricity within the plant. Both Wordsworth and Coleridge came to the conclusion that the flashing effect was indeed in the eye, and not the flower. They became persuaded that the phenomenon was in the nature of an “Ocular Spectrum” or “After Image”. In 1810, the poet and scientist J.W. von Goethe had also questioned whether the flashing seen in flowers was actually in the flower or in the eye.\nWordsworth later added a note of explanation about the “flash” to his ‘Daffodils’ poem in the 1815 printing: “The subject of these Stanzas is rather an elementary feeling and simple expression (approaching to the nature of an ocular spectrum) upon the imaginative faculty, rather than an exertion of it.” Coleridge later acknowledged grudgingly in his Literaria Biographia of 1817 that the concept of “visual spectrum” was indeed “a well known fact”, but at the same time he criticised Wordsworth’s lines about the “flash” as being “mental bombast”, inappropriate for describing the “joy of retrospection”.\nSo what does modern science make of the phenomenon? In 1914, Professor F.A.W. Thomas wrote in the scientific journal, Nature, as that the “Flashing Flowers” (or “Elizabeth Linnaeus phenomenon”) really did exist, and that it was caused by an image of red light moving across the retina of the eye. In 1937, Professor M. Minnaert classified the same phenomenon as an “After Image”. In other words, it has been established that Elizabeth’s “flashing” was an effect within the eye, exactly as Wordsworth and Coleridge eventually came to believe.\nFred Blick is an independent scholar from a multi-disciplinary background. He has published a number of essays over the past twenty years; not only “Wordsworth’s Dark Joke in ‘The Barberry-Tree’” in Romanticism journal in October 2014, but also innovative essays in peer-reviewed academic journals worldwide on the subjects of the Sonnets of William Shakespeare and of Edmund Spenser."}

The new national Gallup poll* gives Rick Perry a 12-point lead over Mitt Romney, putting him at 29 percent – a bigger chunk of the vote than Romney ever commanded in his long-distance frontrunner campaign.\nThe most-covered non-Perry candidates, Bachmann and Huntsman, both lost support. Bachmann lost around a fifth of her support after she won Ames. But I doubt the media has much to do with this. There is a Tea Party conservative vote, and Perry has swooped in to take it from Bachmann. He grabs 33% of it; she has 12%. He gets 34% of weekly churchgoers; she has 9%. He even leads Bachmann in the Midwest, where she trails Ron Paul, too. The best thing Perry has going for him – the problem Romney was always going to have – is his Southern base. He leads Romney by the margin of error in every region of the country except for the South, where he leads 39-12.\nSo, call it: The Bachmann surge is over. Meanwhile, Paul keeps raising the estimate for how big his “ceiling” is. He’s at 18 percent in the Midwest.\n*Inevitable disclaimer: National polls don’t matter right now."}

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "It’s not the food! You may have seen or heard me exclaim this on TV or radio. Yes, it’s all in the mind. You see, the mind really does control the actions we take around food. The mind also controls our emotional response around food. It’s why Weight Loss Hypnosis can really help you lose and manage your weight into the future. Program your mind and you will program what goes into your mouth.\nWhat on Earth is weight loss hypnosis you may ask? Well quite simply, it is an altered state of focused concentration. Oddly I do not use relaxation when using advanced models of weight loss hypnosis. I prefer to use a motivational tone. I like you to be sitting up tall and feeling like a winner, already in control of food and alcohol. Relaxation I believe only makes you feel lethargic, and for weight loss you need to feel motivated, refreshed and confident that you have regained the control over food.\nNow for the exciting bit. What will you experience during weight loss hypnosis? A good (and I mean really good), Weight Loss Hypnotherapist will ensure you experience as many of these sensational experiences as possible.\n1. An immediate state of elevated motivation.\n2. A feeling of renewed confidence that at last you will lose and manage your weight.\n3. A strengthening of your mind to regain control over your choice of food and how much you eat.\n4. A strategy to help you control emotional eating.\n5. An excitement and aspirational feeling to move forward positively.\n7. A sense of supreme self esteem.\n8. The motivation to move your body more.\n9. An aversion to being too fat.\n10. A stronger mindset ability to refuse food and drink when not needed.\n11. Positive acceptance that wearing the clothes of your dreams can be done.\n12. Confidence to manage cravings effectively.\n13. Ability to work through fake hunger.\n14. Confidence to make lifestyle changes aligned to your weight loss.\n15. A much strengthened will power.\n2. Motivational coaching, of the straight talking motivational variety.\n3. The 80-20 meal planning routine.\nAs you know, I am delighted to have supported thousands of people over the years to lose and manage their weight. As I look back on those success stories, I can also recommend that there are a number of things you can do right now to start hypnotising your own mind to lose weight.\nFirstly, implement an 80-20 Meal Planning routine. In other words, reflect on what you have been eating and make simple changes so that you eat healthily 80% of the time and enjoy a little of what you fancy for the remaining 20% of the time.\nSecondly, place bright, bold and strong warning signs in places where you need to be focused. For example the fridge, the cupboards in the kitchen, the car and on your desk at work.\nThirdly, as soon as you get up in the morning, mentally experience an aversion to being too fat. Focus on that for just a few seconds before taking your mind into experiencing a positive, strong and aspirational experience of being slim.\nOne of the biggest benefits of weight loss hypnosis is that it can change your perception of weight loss from one that is ‘hard work’ to one that is exciting, positive and even enjoyable. This really is a big benefit of weight loss hypnosis. Why? Because our behaviours are determined by our perceptions of what is ahead of us. You may have, in the past, experienced the dread and pain of weight loss. Weight loss hypnosis can certainly help ease that pain."}

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "I love watching movies. Or rather I should say I used to love movies and then I liked them and now I love them again. I made a very deliberate effort last year to watch, on average, two movies in the theaters each month. Granted, there are some people who watch way more than that. But movies were making a comeback in my life. In college I studied film as a minor. I was a psychology major. I have always been a psychology-oriented person. But movies are what had pointed me in that direction. Silence of the Lambs had a huge impact on my life. I loved films and they loved me. Then, we fell out of love with one another. I actually didn’t have much time to catch movies. And, so much seemed of iffy quality. Films like Mall Cop, the Fast and the Furious, Transformers and Baywatch just didn’t do it for me.\nThen I had a really horrible year. And then I sought movies out again. And, they didn’t necessarily let me down.\nWe are just one month into the year and I hope to catch as many films as I did last year. One thing I am doing differently so far this year is catching documentaries. I have watched three the past two weeks and it seems that these directors want to make sure we know that the world is a bit dark. But that also, hopefully, people will eventually get caught and brought to justice for the wrongs they have wrought. Everyone wants access and exclusivity. And, many people lead some very fake lives and try to rope us into them. Overall, there is a need for accountability. That is the word for the past two years, it seems.\nI just caught the Netflix movie Fyre: The great party that never happened. Apparently, this non-party occurred just a few years back. Somehow, I missed all the hoopla. I suppose it is because I am not a young uber-rich millenial who has thousands to blow on traveling to a remote island to catch Blink-182 in concert. I am going to state right away, I don’t think I feel sorry for anyone showcased in this film other than the workers in the Bahamas. Some of the people who were conned and showed up the party ended up urinating on mattresses to steer people away from them. I think that is all I have to say. This movie was about the misuse of influencers and lies of a mega-liar. I cannot believe that some of the people interviewed noted that they didn’t think this was how it would all end.\nI also caught the CNN movie called Three Identical Strangers. There was no one you didn’t feel sorry for. Sadly, psychologists come off looking horribly in this documentary about triplet brothers who didn’t grow up with one another and didn’t even know that they others existed until almost adulthood. In the lead up to the film, it was noted that there was no way one could have guessed the twist. Well, it wasn’t all that twisty or nefarious as the trailers wanted you to believe. Although, again, you cannot help but feel sorry for how these people’s lives were grossly manipulated and the pain that they still feel.\nI then caught the documentary series called Surviving R. Kelly. And, after watching this series (which I binged watched) I needed a shower. What a horrible, disgusting human being. However, what is very striking to me were the enablers in his life and how so many of them didn’t see coming the hurt, pain, and comeuppance. I will tell you there are many cringe-worthy moments in which you wonder about all these people and their day-to-day functioning.\nCorrect ! I agree with all your thoughts as i also like movies after watching and analysing the concept of movie.\nOkay, now I have to check out Fyre. And there is so much I have to do today! But, you have pricked my curiosity…I saw Three Identical Strangers as well. Intriguing and sad story.\nMy favorite documentary was Religosity – Bill Maher’s flick – although it is frightening to see how gullible and hypocritical people can be.\nIf you can tell me where that movie line comes from, I ll send you one big virtual hug! I can see the Godfather trilogy endless times.. it makes me feel nostalgic and at peace. Michael’s tragedy is everyone’s life."}

Plus, she seems to not understand the concept of a start time to class, as she comes in EVERY DAY around 6 or 6:15, feigning embarrassment, despite the fact that class starts at 5:30. This shouldn’t bother me that much, but on top of everything else, it makes me want to punch her in the face.\nLoving: That they are making Rock Band for Wii.\nHating: That I cannot afford a Wii OR a rock band for the Wii. Or a Wii Fit, which looks totally awesome too.\nThat last one is completely random, but really…they HAD to make Rock Band for Wii? Because I didn’t already want to spend all my nonexistent money buying a Wii and a Wii fit?\nSorry to be such a downer lately.

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "This may sound contradictory, but you’ll need moisturized skin to minimize makeup slippage later in the day. This is a fact especially important for my oily-skinned sistren (a lack of adequate moisture triggers pores to produce oil in excess). The trick is finding the elusive moisturizer equilibrium. A new staple in my routine is Valmont’s Hydra 3 Regenetic, a serum actually, that hydrates better than many a moisturizer. It sinks into pores for a lightweight, but thirst quenching guzzle of water to skin (probably due to its abundance of a precursor to the moisture powerhouse, hyaluronic acid).\nPrimers are essential too. Not all primers work well though, but two of the very best are Hourglass’s Veil Mineral Primer and Cover FX’s Mattifyng Primer with Anti-Acne Treatment (which I highly recommend if you’re more than prone to a breakout or two).\nOn days when I’m feeling extra fancy and want to dip into an eye shadow, Blinc’s Eye Shadow Primer is more than required. I can personally attest to its pigment-gripping powers that prolong the flimsiest of shadows on the balmiest of summer days.\nUnless you’re a masochist, liquid and cream foundations are out of the question in the summer (with one small exception I’ll mention in a minute). Powders are best, but BB creams are a useful alternative if your skin tends to be dry. My all time favorite foundation is bareMinerals’ Matte loose powder—it was made for days when the humidity levels read like a winning grade report (99% anyone?). If you’re seeking heavier coverage, Pur Minerals’ 4-in-1 Pressed Powder and Make Up For Ever’s Multi-Use Powder Foundation are also first-class formulas. The one caveat to summer liquid foundation makeup is Armani’s Maestro, which sinks into skin the same way foam slips into a full-bodied latte. As far as BB creams, Iman’s version is always a welcome experience.\nEye makeup is another frontier, and if you’re not careful, a few hours in the summer heat can leave liner and mascara anywhere but on your eyes. There’s nothing that can stop a waterproof eyeliner, however, and I strongly recommend Smashbox’s and Dior’s versions (Java and Trinidad Black are my regular go-tos). For lashes, there’s water-resistant mascara from Chantecaille, which is a new favorite that I hate/love (hate that’s it’s pricey but love that it works for fullness, length, longevity, and no clumps).\nAll makeup, no matter the formula, requires a setting powder. My favorite is Tarte’s Amazonian Clay Finishing Powder, which keeps makeup in place without casting a chalky shadow. Using a foundation brush, I press the powder (pressing works better than sweeping, I’ve found) onto my forehead, nose, and above my chin. The super fine powder applies smooth and translucent for both dark and fair complexions alike. Throughout the day blotting papers are essential, so I typically carry a pack of Paula’s Choice Oil Blotting Papers in my bag. You know what also works: toilet seat covers. I am in no way ashamed to admit that I’ve siphoned a cover or two from the office bathroom to keep developing oil at bay.\nWith these tools in place you’ll be ready to fight the good fight against balmy weather. After all, balmy weather ain’t all that bad: my curly hair has never looked better.\nGreat tips!

We're concerned about achieving satisfaction at work and at home, prompting us to establish a solid foundation before we take our first steps. Unfortunately, we might mistakenly believe that our desires must be stifled, or else we'll suffer from the consequences of our actions. However, we derive great courage from the direct turn of independent Uranus.\nIt's often said that talk is empty without intent and follow through -- that actions speak louder than words. Nevertheless, there are times when open communication is more productive than grand gestures that don't achieve the desired results. This New Moon is conjunct Mercury the Messenger, bringing an opportunity to get our thoughts out into the open. Since Mercury is retrograde, it makes sense to initiate conversations about lingering tensions that are begging for attention. A New Moon ritual that involves creating resolutions for 2017 is a perfect use of the cosmic energy while auspicious Jupiter and karmic Saturn are also in the equation.\nGet advice for every facet of your life as you step into 2017! Start your Horoscope Tarot reading now.\nLearn more about the impact of this New Moon in YOUR life with your sign's New Moon Horoscope below.\nSomething is different this morning, like someone sneaked an extra shot or two of caffeine into your morning coffee. The goal-oriented Capricorn New Moon falls in your 10th House of Career, motivating you to create success no matter what the cost. The downside is that you may believe you must be ruthless with yourself and sacrifice personal comforts to get ahead; the truth is, the more authentically you live in all ways, the higher you will climb.\nSomehow you know that the time has come to focus on the many things you want to accomplish. The conservative Capricorn New Moon brings your 9th House of Big Ideas down to earth, encouraging you to find concrete ways to move toward your distant goals. It could feel like the journey to achievement requires that you pay a steep price, but don't be deceived by your own negativity. Joan Baez said, \"Action is the antidote to despair.\"\nIt feels like you are turning the page to start a more serious chapter in life. The accountable Capricorn New Moon highlights your 8th House of Regeneration, signaling the beginning of a new period of growth. Although hope usually accompanies the start of something new, you may think you must relinquish your imaginative and playful self to grow up. Luckily, this isn't the case since unconventional Uranus begins its march forward once again, giving you access to a treasure trove of inspiration. Mencius wrote, \"The great person never loses a childlike spirit.\"\nThe heaviness of responsibility weighs on your mind as you anticipate the daunting road ahead. The Capricorn New Moon emphasizes your 7th House of Relationships, requiring you to reassess your commitments. Of course, you long for safety and security but sometimes the search for those qualities might seem more like a business transaction than a loving connection. Thankfully, you can benefit from the best of both worlds if you call on your inner rebel when you need to remember who you are and what you want.\nIt's time to turn over a new leaf and be accountable for your decisions. The dutiful Capricorn New Moon calls attention to your 6th House of Wellbeing, urging you to implement healthier and more responsible habits. It can feel like a buzzkill thinking about all the fun you must give up to change your ways, but your new regimen doesn't have to be a prison. Reframe your idea of what it means to live a good life and you might just discover pursuing self-care brings you a deeper sense of joy.\nSometimes nothing is more gratifying than putting in hard work and seeing the fruits of your labor. Not everyone understands how you can enjoy combing through the details and setting everything just right, but you truly have a gift for making chores seem like a game. The pragmatic Capricorn New Moon stabilizes your 5th House of Play, prescribing a fun new project that you can be involved with for the long haul. However, don't romanticize suffering or toiling; what seems like a good idea may prove to be a burden later, so temper your admirable ambition with a dash of common sense.\nAn idea is being planted and it's up to you to create an environment that will encourage it to grow to its fullest potential. The stabilizing Capricorn New Moon settles in your 4th House of Foundations -- the ground in which the seed is planted. The earthy nature of this lunation may feel heavy as it roots you where you stand, but there's no need to be discouraged. Stop watering the weeds in your life and start watering the flowers.\nLanguage is more powerful than any tool, whether you're building a structure or tearing one down. The stern Capricorn New Moon stabilizes your 3rd House of Communication, drawing attention to your words and how you use them. You must decide whether you want to fearfully build walls around your mind or to openly explore new ways of learning. You may believe the only solution is strict censorship, but this is not the case. The deeper you look, the more you realize your own potential to frame your message wisely.\nThe outlook for the future appears overcast for some reason, even if the skies are clear of clouds. The frugal Capricorn New Moon falls in your 2nd House of Self-Esteem, highlighting your resources and how they influence your belief system. You feel the push to put your budget in order and it might seem as if you must limit your spending more than you expected. Tightening your belt is always prudent, but don't panic needlessly. Remember, money can't buy happiness; true worth comes from within.\nA new emotional cycle is beginning and a surprising feeling of significance hangs in the air. The New Moon is in your solemn sign, renewing your sense of purpose and direction. Keep in mind that self-denial and delayed gratification are not the same things. While discipline is required to accomplish anything worthwhile, a balance must be struck between ambition and self-care. You have the power to get where you want to go, but don't run yourself into the ground to get there.\nIt may be a normal day on the outside, but there is quite a contrasting experience going on in the deepest reaches of your mind. The Capricorn New Moon lands in your 12th House of Spiritual Insights, calling you to put greater emphasis on your inner world. The austere energy of this lunation brings forth an image of a holy person living alone in isolation, but metaphysical knowledge doesn't always require asceticism. Simply introduce consistency to your meditative practice and you will notice a subtle but powerful change. Poet Ella Wheeler Wilcox wrote, \"The spark Divine dwells in thee; let it grow.\"\nYou feel that the time has come to commit yourself to a cause that is near and dear to your heart. The dutiful Capricorn New Moon occurs in your 11th House of Social Networking, inspiring you to give back to your community. On one hand, you're ready to dedicate as much as possible to an organization or movement but on the other hand, you're wondering if you possess the stamina to maintain the efforts for any sustained period. Try not to dedicate yourself to a cause in the spirit of sacrifice; approach your altruistic acts with a healthy balance, so passionate service does not turn into a martyr complex."}

This past year I have had to do major rethinking about sanitation. Let’s start with water – we use it to take our bath, make breakfast, stay hydrated, keep clean, clean up our homes, flush our toilets… see how much gets done with water! Hopefully this helps us to realize how integral water is to our lives.\nCurrently water and sanitation are in dire situation in most areas of Lagos State and there is a direct correlation to ending hardship in getting sanitation right.\nThe World Bank has research states that good hygiene is the most economical health intermediation available.\nWhat does Sanitation entail? Sanitation is about providing amenities which can safely dispose of all sorts of waste and maintain public hygiene. This involves operating immaculate and nontoxic toilets, keeping water supplies clean and disposing of garbage safely.\nSanitation is a global issue that affects the health and well-being of all populations, and their environment.\nHere are 4 reasons why increased funding for water and sanitation is super important in ending excessive poverty.\nSanitation is directly related to the health of all humans and can thwart the hazardous spread of diseases. Deficient sanitation is a major cause of disease with more than 50% of the world’s hospital beds filled with people experiencing sanitation-related diseases, research carried out by the Hesperian Foundation bears this fact out. Illnesses like diarrhea, worms, cholera and malaria instigated by poor sanitation unnecessarily take the lives of millions of people every day, with diarrhea alone responsible for the deaths of close to 5,000 children a day Unicef states.\nThe provision of sanitary environs such as proper toilets, clean flowing water and a means of harmless garbage disposal can therefore prevent the occurrence of such extensive disease and death.\nYes, Education and Sanitation are tied hip to hip. Sanitation enables children to have fair access to education to help them thrive in life as adults. The United Nations states that diseases borne from a lack of good sanitation can cause can have a knock-on effect on a child’s education.\nWhen a child has consecutive intestinal infections, they deprive them of important nutrients, delay their development and culminates in poor school turnout and performance. The effects of poor sanitation in under developed nations are mostly felt by girls (Unicef).\nGirls are often the main chore bearers; saddled with household chores of walking miles to fetch clean water, causing them to drop out.\nSanitation is instrumental in boosting economic development of a country by affording the means for a healthy workforce while slashing the demand on public health services. Unicef declares that if everyone in the world had access to running water and sanitation amenities, the drop-in diarrhea would save the health sector enormous amounts of money and productivity.\nI am more concerned about the desensitization of sanitation as a norm and accepting filthy environments within the psyches (mindsets) of our children. That is truly worrisome because they have no idea about the extent of damage that bad sanitation will unleash on them.\nShe is an Advocate of STEM Education and is Passionate about Education reform.

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "I see high end or custom instruments with sandwiched necks, typically with layers of light colored maple up the back, and on the headstock. Looks cool, no doubt, but Is this type of construction purely decorative, or does it serve a structural purpose too, perhaps in lieu of a truss rod? Thanks.\nLaminated necks are stronger and more stable, so there's little chance of getting a twisted neck. And I agree they look nice too if a contrasting centre wood is used.\nAs a maker, more care is needed to keep things symmetrical if using a contrasting wood. If the central element is off centre, it's particularly noticeable at the heel. The headstock can be veneered and cover any error there.\nI am not that convinced they are all that much stronger. Mind you a laminated neck does help out if you hit the neck on something and with a solid piece of wood it cracks along the grain line. If you use a harder wood in the middle and there was an appreciable amount of center wood then yes. Doing a bookmatch type of sandwich of the outer wood does help by canceling out some of the movement that humidity changes may cause. Most of the time this is not an issue on a good piece of wood for necks. The center strip can help with the visual aspect rather than joining the side pieces without it.\nThat is a very good question. The two brands that I've played who have sandwiched necks are Bruko and Loprinzi. I know that the ukes are good and I know they have a good reputation for being durable, too. So I'm going to say \"At the very least, they don't hurt.\" I've been assuming that they help with structural integrity, though you do have a point in that I'm not positive they actually do have a structural purpose.\nLaminated necks are absolutely stronger and less susceptible to twisting / warping. I find them aesthetically pleasing.\nLess susceptible to twisting and warping maybe, but how does the strength increase? Unless you stick in a stronger wood then a laminated piece should be no stronger than a solid piece.\nIt's in the way the grain in each layer opposes the other. It makes a stronger neck.\nThat mean nothing, sorry to pick on you, I just hear this all the time and nobody explains how it makes the wood stronger. Either way, solid piece or a laminate of the same wood, the outer fibers of the beam (the neck being a beam) takes most of the stress. I don't see the outer fibers being any stronger, the main concern is the wood being pulled apart as it is being bent. The inner fibers are in compression (the inside of the bent neck) and they do not fail before the fibers in tension. Unless the wood has the grain at an angle to the length of the neck a solid piece should be in the same range of a laminated piece.\nPeople are using the word \"stronger' when they mean stiffer, which is not the same thing.\nThere are many studies similar to this one on the interwebs. What I never see are studies showing the opposite to be true.\n\"The neck of guitar is a mechanical structure with a complex geometry which involves many operations and technological solutions with minimal materials consumption, and providing rigitdity to maintain the strings tension during the playing. meeting these requirements is an ongoing challenge for manufacturing because the wood used in the structure of the guitar neck is different as a speicies, as a structure, as physical-mechanical properties and rheological behavior. The paper containing mahogany-maple-mahogany and others containing masarnduba-maple-masaranduba. The samples were subjected to the three-point bending with different intensities of loads (400, 800, 1000, 1400 N), determining for each maximum deflection and the maximum stresses. It was found that the use of laminated wood increases the rigidity of the guitar neck and the bending resistance; the most advantageous combination is masaranduba-maple-masaranduba.\"\n\"Keywords: solid wood, glued laminated wood, guitar, three points bending, stifness, beam of constant strength\"\n\"Analyzing the values of maximum displacement in the force direction, it was found that samples from solid wood presents the greatest deflections, regardless of the applied load , which is about 120..250% higher than values obtained on laminated wood samples made from m asaranduba with maple (Fig. 4 a, b). This indicates that guitar neck stiffness can be increased by using a combination of least two wood species\"\nFor my arch top guitars and ukulele, I sandwich a v shaped piece of mahogany between two pieces of maple, cut at 45 degrees. When shaped the neck looks like a piece of bookmatched maple with a thin mahogany stripe down the back. It is in fact about 70% mahogany, which is far more stable than maple.\nAnother angle on this...just got on a LoPrinzi tenor, with a sandwiched (laminate) neck. The depth of the neck is thinner than most, so I assume the laminate neck provides additional strength, although I see some LoPrinzis without it.\nSo what does that tell us? Does it tell us that a laminate neck is stronger than a solid neck? No. The proper way of doing this would be to use the same wood in the laminate as the solid piece. By adding different woods to the laminate sandwich it is no longer apples to apples comparison but rather apples to oranges. What if solid samples of the Mahogany and the Masaranduba were stronger than the solid Maple? Making a sandwich of them and the maple is naturally going to be stronger.\nSorry, I worked in a mechanical test lab and broke my share of samples. This paper is not worth a heck of a lot.\nMost laminated necks include center strips of contrasting, quartersawn, woods that are often equally as strong or stronger than the main blank. Stronger more often than not. I think when builders talk about sandwiched necks, this is what we mean. Otherwise we'd be making bread sandwiches; small slices of bread between two pieces of bread, which doesn't seem very interesting or appetizing to me. Some, a few, are laminated from the same stock. I'd guess they'd be at least less susceptible to warping, possibly even stiffer, than a neck that hasn't been laminated, due to the opposing grain patterns.

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "A still from Jordan Peele’s Us, 2019.\nIn one sequence in Jordan Peele’s new film, Us, one character, staring at an uncanny image of people serenely clasping hands, says that what he’s seeing looks like “some kind of fucked-up performance art.” He’s not quite right (it’s actually just a sign of evil things to come), but, as it turns out, a performance artist did have a hand in the film’s production.\nThat artist is Madeline Hollander, whose dance-grounded performances about forms of bodily control have earned her praise among critics and a place in the forthcoming Whitney Biennial. For Us, a film about a family whose beachfront home is invaded by creepy döppelgangers, Hollander supplied choreography, working closely with Lupita Nyong’o to develop the pronounced movements for both of her characters—Adelaide, the family’s paranoid matriarch, and Red, her rage-filled double who has spent her life underground in a decrepit subterranean underpass.\nTo hear more about Hollander’s role in the film’s production, ARTnews spoke with the artist, whose background in ballet helped her supply the Nutcracker-inspired choreography in one prominent sequence. The conversation, which includes spoilers for Us, follows below. It has been edited and condensed for clarity.\nARTnews: How did you get involved with the film?\nMadeline Hollander: I was approached by Ian Cooper, who’s one of the producers on the film. There was a part of the script that was a reference to The Nutcracker. Jordan wanted these dual ballet compositions at the end—one for the underpass and one for the real world. Ian knew that I’d done The Nutcracker a million times growing up. He called me to discuss this scene, brainstorm, go through the script, and make sure that the terminology when the characters are speaking is correct.\nARTnews: Your most prominent work in the film comes toward the end, where a fight sequence between Adelaide and Red is intercut with footage of younger versions of their characters (both played by Ashley McKoy) performing The Nutcracker. Tell me about how you choreographed that.\nHollander: The choreography in the scene is a hybrid, fusing together the Sugar Plum and Cavalier from [choreographer George] Balanchine’s traditional Nutcracker into one solo. It’s both the male and female parts in one dance, and then completely distorted and inverted, almost puppeteered, as if the dancer on the top, in the theater, was dragging around the dancer below via a magnet, through the ceiling.\nI met with Jordan to talk about this. I went with a mash-up, kind of Frankensteining clips from my own work, which tends to go into the uncanny or distorted realms. In that conversation, we started talking about all the other kinds of doubling, and it very organically moved into talking about doing movement direction for all the other characters, their tethered versions.\nARTnews: The movements of the aboveground characters are often played against those of their underground other halves, or their tethered versions, as they’re called in the film. With Adelaide, for example, her movements are smooth, whereas Red’s are jerky yet still somehow graceful. How did you direct Nyong’o’s movements?\nHollander: It all came from Jordan having really clear ideas of the characters’ personalities. It was really about maintaining the integrity and core soul of the character, but really putting them on opposite realms of something normal or pedestrian. I ended up going through the script and making motion-direction notes for almost every line. Hours into the meeting, Jordan brought in a storyboard artist, and we mapped out the final climax scene and other scenes that had to do with doubling. Lupita was supposed to be an ex-ballet dancer in the film, so she has a specific way of moving. You can always spot who’s been classically trained versus who’s not been. Part of the beginning discussion, after doing the Nutcracker sequence, was: What was it that Lupita would need to do to get trained, so that that would be real?\nLupita moves very gracefully and quietly as Adelaide, and then as Red, she retains this very erect, super rigid ballet spine, and she has a set of movements that are like a Pac-Man meets a cockroach with a book on her head. There’s no balance in Red’s walk. That was developed to contrast the fluidity and movement of this other character, who’s supposed to be motherly.\nARTnews: The movements of the other family members are equally pronounced. Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph), Adelaide’s daughter, also has a very defined way of moving.\nHollander: Shahadi’s character is an athlete and a teenager, and her double is always pitched forward, on the tip of her toes, ready to sprint at any moment, and just obsessed with Zora—always staring straight at her, always knowing that she could outrun her. It’s just that angle forward, that very slight, five-degree angle forward, that creates this uncanny, creepy vibe.\nARTnews: It’s interesting how choreographed the motion is for each character, even the background ones without dialogue. Shortly before that climactic fight, there’s a scene meant to mirror the opening, where, in 1986, a child version of Adelaide walks along a boardwalk. Everyone she sees there reappears underground in a flashback, but their movements aren’t quite natural.\nHollander: Everyone on the boardwalk is cast down to the scene below. It was really fun for me to create a signature move [for each character] that would get completely distorted for the underpass—to set all these pedestrian moves in motion and to let them do it until it felt pedestrian. Not something like the typical zombie movie, but something very subtle, like leaning toward one side or stumbling, or only looking to the right while they’re bulldozing forward. If everyone’s doing something even subtly off, it creates this really eerie landscape. That was really exciting, to me.\nARTnews: When you were working on the motions, were you doing it with the actors on set? How did you train them?\nHollander: Over the summer, I auditioned dancers to find someone who could do both ballet and distorted contemporary movement, and also someone who would look like Lupita as a teenager. I was working with Ashley, and I was also working with Lupita, going through the script and working through what the gestures would be—how you would lounge at the beach, how you would sit up or down, what you do after a long car ride. I was training her in ballet—I was going through the basics of what it means to have this training as a background. She did ballet classes every single morning. We looked at references like the witch in Sleeping Beauty, that angular movement. We also did a lot of training where she would move backwards, where she’d be learning to move from her back instead of her front, and a lot of work with her spinal cord, her neck, keeping her shoulders down. On set, I was helping adjust things constantly, making sure there was continuity with the characters throughout the script. A lot of that was improvising with Jordan and the actors.\nARTnews: The attention that’s paid to movement within the film is actually one of the great things about Us. I’ve seen a lot of reviews mention this, which is unusual.\nARTnews: I’ve noticed that there’s a lot of dance in new horror movies. In Annihilation, there’s a very climactic, very choreographed sequence at the end, and there’s of course Suspiria, which focuses on a witches’ coven in a ballet school. Why do you think horror directors have become so interested in dance all of a sudden?\nHollander: That’s a very good question. The body is something that people are paying attention to differently right now than at any other time. What’s interesting is that, in Suspiria and these other films, they’re referencing specific choreographers. In Suspiria, for example, they’re referencing Martha Graham. But one of the things I admired about working with Jordan was that he really wanted everything to be completely new. Even if he was referencing The Nutcracker, it wouldn’t look like Balanchine. It was always a hybrid of many sources, pulling from Michael Jackson’s “Thriller,” The Exorcist, Death Becomes Her. One of the amazing parts of the film is how detailed and nuanced a lot of the movement it is. But you probably wouldn’t notice unless you watched it a few times."}

The youngster’s fearlessness undid Norrie in a far earlier than expected exit.\nHe has the scope to do better here. Already boosted with a winning head to head over the Aussie Jordan Thompson, he got the better of him in four sets at the US Open last year, as well as a win on the Challenger Tour the year before.\nThompson, previously better known for defeating Andy Murray at Queen’s in 207 after coming through qualifying, at the start of the Brit’s woes with his hip. He learned his trade having to battle against bigger juniors, scrapping for his points, and now he is a lot stronger and athletic, he still has that gritty tendency.\nHe has a good all-court game and seems to be at ease either at the back of the court, or finishing up his points at the net. He has a great serve and pretty solid groundstrokes. What he might lack though is the consistency that Norrie has been showing over the past 12 months or so. Norrie has quietly built himself up to be the British No. 2, has made his first final at the start of the year, and is still on the rise.\nNorrie also can do a bit of everything, and moves very well around the court. With his improved forehand, strong backhand – perhaps the only area where he could get hurt is if Thompson wins a few more points on his serve.\nPrediction: Norrie in three sets.\nIt has been a busy time in the US for Dan Evans. After reaching the Quimper Challenger final straight after the Australian Open, he reached a second ATP final in Delray Bean and the semi-final of the Indian Wells Challenger event before the main deal. A couple of solid wins in the qualifying rounds, but a first round draw against Stan Wawrinka, he at least took the Swiss the distance, before bowing out.\nMaybe the amount of tennis he had in his legs was catching up with him. He managed one win in the Phoenix Challenger, and actually fell in the second round of qualifying, but got in as a lucky loser.\nHe will face Malek Jaziri in the first round. The Tunisian has a big serve that Evans will really need to try and get on the end of to be able to go toe-to-toe with him, although could more than match his aggressive style.\nDepending on his levels of fatigue, Evans ought to make things tricky for the Tunisian. His bad tempered outburst at the officials resulted in him having a point docked for hitting a water-bottle and shows he is fraying at the edges."}

We got on the scoreboard in the 7th minute when Shane Beirne fisted a point quickly followed by a point from play from Caleb Duffy. The home side had the next 2 points before we hit 4 points on the trot between the 16th and 24th minute from James Flynn, Caleb Duffy (2) & Martin Beirne. Dromahair hit back with 3 points of their own to lead 1-05 to 0-6 at the break. The home side kicked on after the interval and points in the 32nd & 34th minute saw them lead by 4. Martin Beirne landed a free in reply but another free in the 42nd minute proved to be their last score. The home side were reduced to 14 men and played a rearguard action to protect their lead. Martin Beirne in the 47th minute and a long range Diarmuid McKiernan free left 2 points in it with 10 minutes remaining. We were unable to find a way through in that time and it was the first minute of injury time when Bryan Beirne landed a long range score to bring us within one. As time was running out Martin Raftery was the hero when he popped up with the equaliser in the 4th minute of stoppage time to secure a share of the spoils. In a must win game on Saturday evening we came out on top in a tight encounter with table toppers Annaduff. Again another slow start saw us trail 1-04 to 0-01 at the end of the opening quarter. The visitors raced into a 3 point lead in 7 minutes before Caleb Duffy pointed from play after great work from Kyle Flynn in defence. Annaduff added another point and then as they dominated possession struck for a goal on 12 minutes. Martin Beirne replied with a free and then in the 20th minute hit the net to bring us back into the game. Thomas Mulvey added a point from play and in the 26th minute Ciaran Walsh got on the end of a move to strike for our second goal and put us in the lead for the first time. However on the stroke of half time Annaduff were awarded a penalty & converted to leave the interval score 2-04 to 2-03 to the visitors. Annaduff had the first 2 points of the second half inside 2 minutes but Caleb Duffy was on hand in the 33rd minute to grab our third goal & level the game. Both sides missed chances before Annaduff edged ahead again in the 42nd minute. Martin Beirne converted a free to level again going into the last quarter. Annaduff scored from a free to lead again on 49 minutes but this was short lived as Martin Raftery broke up field to level once more. Diarmuid McKiernan converted a pressure 45 after missing a couple earlier with 5 minutes remaining. When Annaduff hit a great long range equaliser in the 58th minute it looked like they would secure the point they needed to confirm promotion. However with the game in injury time Caleb Duffy hit a free and then added a final point from play after a brilliant interception by David Wynne to close out the game on a score line of 3-08 to 2-09.Scorers: Martin Beirne 1-03; Caleb Duffy 1-03; Ciaran Walsh 1-00; Thomas Mulvey 0-01; Martin Raftery 0-01.

My son was not happy because this is not what he wants to do on vacation! So I finish checking in and leave all of our luggage at the resort and we move on to our first stop.\nANIMAL KINGDOM!!! I don't think anyone really realized where we were and I honestly was a bit upset that we didn't get the reaction we were expecting. We thought these kids would be jumping for joy when they realized where we were. The only one that was really happy was my baby girl -- she was so surprised!! When we made it in the park, One of my nieces, the 13 year old, thanked hubby once she realized where we were - the other one, my nephew who is 10, still didn't fully know where he was. He knew it was a theme park but had no clue this was part of Disney - he came to find out we were at Disney the next day....LOL. My 16 year old niece didn't seem to thrilled, she was happy I guess, but I know she would've rather been back home already - I think she really missed her boyfriend, ugh....teenagers!!!\nAnyway, we moved on, ignored the long faces and went on to enjoy our day - 1st stop....Dinoland U.S.A.\nNext up is my favorite ride in all of Animal Kingdom!!!\nWe took a break from walking at Flights of Wonder.....I love this show and I even caught my son laughing.....FINALLY a smile!!! Too bad I couldn't capture it in a picture.....trust me, I tried."}

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "Getting married can be easy and enjoyable or it can be turmoil, stress and worry. It all depends on how you do it and the type of people that you surround yourself with. We are not talking here about family and friends, obviously, they are important, and the truth is that they are going to support you and help out in whatever way they can. Instead, we are talking about the staff and the people you have working for you behind the scenes to make the day a success. The better your crew or hired help, the easier it will be for you on the day. In that regard here are the key people that you need when assembling your team for the big day.\nAll the roles are very important, but the one that trumps all others is the person who holds it all together from start to finish. We are talking of course about the planner. To find a reputable one, speak to friends or go online and search for something like ‘wedding planner northern beaches’. There should be enough intelligence from that procedure to see who is highlighted and who isn’t. then meet and spell out your vision. Make sure that you gel with the person concerned because they will be your go-to on eth day.\nAs much as you might want to cut corners and opt for a family member to do the job, this is quite simply wedding suicide. If yours is a sit-down affair, then the food needs to be good and the service and slick. No long queues or some tables finished before others have been served. You need a team of people who can cater to large numbers with quality food.\nMany are the party that has been killed with bad music. Remember this is your wedding and your friends. They will probably dance no matter what tunes are played because they want to create a memorable day for you, so don’t let the DJ tell you what works and what doesn’t. you should definitely be guided by him but also make sure that he plays tunes that are significant to you and which will mean things to you and your friends.\nThe photographer is there to capture the event for prosperity, he is not there to contribute to the ambience on the day. As such he needs to blend in and get the job done without really being noticed. Without a doubt you are going to want some quality images from the big day, so the photographer needs to be somebody with a good portfolio. But the truth is that most people end up with a wedding album full of pictures that they very seldom look at. A few good shots for the dresser or the mantlepiece (or for the Facebook profile picture) are critical, but don’t stress about getting too many, it is more important to be present on the day – and a good photographer will allow you to be that as they do their job unobtrusively in the background."}
{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "Anyone who does business with Madison Avenue knows there's a revolution afoot. Some big advertising agency holding companies are spending billions buying up tech ventures that play key roles in the burgeoning marketing category of ad-tech. Large technology companies are aggressively acquiring elements to assemble what they call a \"marketing stack\" or \"marketing cloud.\" And Internet giants are building, buying, and partnering to establish market dominance as the world's most powerful advertising services companies, based on privileged access to some of the highest-quality first-party customer data of any advertising platform in the world.\nFor anyone who believes that the past few years have been business as usual for marketers, a rude awakening awaits. But for those who have anxiously anticipated the moment when CRM would enter mainstream marketing, it's time to get excited. No longer are one-to-one communications with consumers limited to direct response communications. Now, individually targeted messaging is becoming a fact of life—or at least an option—for marketers in the mainstream.\nIndeed, marketers finally have an intelligent response to that conundrum posed by 19th-century department store magnate John Wanamaker, who lamented, \"Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don't know which half.\" While we haven't exorcised Wanamaker's ghost entirely, we can challenge his dictum when it comes to digitally addressable media.\nOnly recently has digital media become a significant part of most marketing programs. Of the $550 billion projected marketing investments in 2015, roughly 25 percent will be for digital media. Digital media provides an opportunity for marketers to track advertising investments against outcomes with unprecedented rigor.\nOf course, increasing precision in measurement thanks to digital technology is nothing new. What's new is the rise of marketing automation. This is what Madison Avenue is abuzz about: namely, the programmatic buying and selling of advertising.\nDigital advertising is increasingly bought and sold in public and private marketplaces known as advertising exchanges. In these fully electronic markets, buyers (brands and their agencies) come together with sellers (publishers and their representatives) to exchange dollars for placements across every conceivable type of digital media.\nIn these digital ad exchanges, something truly unprecedented is taking place. To wit, while advertisers still judge price based on a cost-per-thousand metric (CPM), their trading desk partners are buying impressions individually and algorithmically, and grossing them up into bundles of a thousand for CPM pricing purposes.\nThis means that advertising placed programmatically is actually being targeted in a manner consistent with one-to-one or direct marketing communications. Every time a user sends through a request for a Web page, an \"ad call\" goes out to various ad exchanges. The exchanges present that individual impression, along with a host of accompanying data, to provide potential bidders with a profile against which they can set a bid price. Data may include machine type, browser, location, and a rich array of profiling data based on cookies and tags placed by third-party sites on the user's browser.\nThis speaks volumes about the potential value of any given user to any given advertiser. This entire process that results in an ad placement—known as real-time bidding—takes, start to finish, an industry average of 65 milliseconds. That's less time than it takes to blink an eye.\nProgrammatic buying and selling of ad inventory today accounts for approximately 20 percent of digital ad investments. That's up from practically nothing three years ago. As its use expands within digital media, marketers will realize a level of precision unprecedented outside of direct channels. When such techniques are linked to CRM databases to further enrich and enable better real-time decision-making, all bets are off in terms of how effective—as well as efficient—marketing may become. And, of course, programmatic techniques will become commonplace across traditional media, too, as the steady march of digitalization of all media advances.\nThat's why we'll soon know the answer to Wanamaker's question. We'll also know something else. When advertising works, and we can prove it, most marketers won't want to spend less. They'll spend more.\nJeffrey Rayport is a faculty member in entrepreneurial management at Harvard Business School.

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "Monday saw a trip to see my consultant, ten days after the operation. He removed the dressing and showed me what a splendid job he had done with the stitches. He sent me upstairs for an x-ray (don’t worry, there’s a lift), and when I came back down he showed me the results of his handiwork from inside. It made me feel quite sick as I saw how much he had sawed into the bone and the size of the bracket and pins. There was another chap in the waiting room with a very similar scar (we HTO patients like to wear shorts to show our wounds as badges of honour). Anyway, it was six weeks since his operation and he was almost walking ok, though still with the occasional use of crutches. Unfortunately he had not yet been passed fit to drive. It was an uncomfortable journey home as the full extent of the ‘injury’ began to sink in.\nIt didn’t get any better on Tuesday, with Zac faffing about in the morning and missing his bus. Despite her assertions to the contrary, Sally ended up giving him a lift, for which he paid with two days without his X-Box. That can be a double edged sword, and later that night, whilst Sally was giving me yet another injection into my stomach (only three more to go) Zac was allegedly doing some homework that involved a cake, grapes, and a glue gun! The kitchen was a right mess – we would have all been better off if he’d have been on his X-Box.\nTuesday was actually a busy day, as my own activity started with a visit to the physio. Alarmingly steep stairs up to her treatment room, but thanks to a lift from Clayton and some skillful crutch work I made it in one piece. She was very impressed with my progress, a good range of movement and inflexion of over 100 degrees, but she gave me some leg raises and leg straightening exercises that were excruciating. At one point she asked me if I was going to be sick.\nI have to say that incapacitation is not a situation that I enjoy, but it is equally bad for Sally and the kids. So after returning from the physio I had a couple of hours before I needed to bed down into my office to do some work, and I headed for the kitchen. I laid out all of the ingredients so that I wouldn’t have to move too much, and I made chilli chicken and syrup sponge pudding. Ole would be mightily relieved that he could get something good to eat (not that Sally wasn’t trying her best, of course), and Zac and sponge are a match made in heaven, though he did scrape off the syruppy bits!\nThat is a recipe from Mmm…No1…Cookbook, and one advantage of lying horizontal day and night is it gives me a chance to spend the evenings filling in Mmm…No2…Cookbook, as well as adding to my ‘The History Of Zombies’ project. This is to try to get Zac off his X-Box and into books, and this week we received a reading list from Chapel School. I must admit that I wouldn’t like to read many of the titles on there, and Zac was adamant that he doesn’t like reading stories as they are too long and boring and don’t have any pictures in. Note to self – illustrate ‘The History Of Zombies’. So now, Zac is reading Harry Potter and the something or other. He got it from Ole, and when I asked how he was getting on he couldn’t even remember the title. Ole, surprisingly, is showing an interest in the stock market, and he is reading ‘Financial Reckoning Day’ by Bill Bonner and Addison Wiggins. If you are vaguely interested in money, stocks, shares and commodities I thoroughly recommend it. Entertaining and informative. However, its not all fun and games, and there are times when I feel quite sorry for myself. The melancholy usually hits when I look in the fridge!\nJust when I thought it couldn’t get any worse, my Sky Box went on the blink. Not catastrophically, it was just that the Programme Synopsis didn’t show up. Never really realised how useful that is until it wasn’t there. Over the last few weeks there have also been a few other quirks, such as failing to record, taking ages to boot up, etc. The box is over five years old and therefore way beyond warranty, so when I called Sky I wasn’t surprised to hear that it would cost me over £200 to replace plus £65 call out. However, they gave me the option of taking a six month warranty out on the existing box which would cost £10 per month. That would cover my current issue. Ok then, sounds like a bargain. The engineer was booked to come out on Friday.\nMore problems for Zac, he has been told by his tutor at school that his bag smells. I’m not really surprised, and after removing more rotting fruit and underwear it was once again consigned to the wash. Any ideas?\nBetter news on Wednesday, I have won 200,000,000 something from some kind of Nigerian lottery. An American lady managed to sneak it out of the country before fraudsters got their hands on it, for which I am, of course, eternally grateful. My favourite bit of the email was the last line – ‘If found in spam move to inbox’.\nToday was a busy day with the Sky engineer arriving right in the middle of it. Within little more than ten minutes he had diagnosed the fault and quickly replaced not only the box but also the Sky dish with brand new equipment. No real down side, as he also told us that our previous recordings will all have gone, so I no longer have to worry about the series link of ‘Come Dine With Me!\nI have been on calls for most of the day, all work related, and when they finally died down Sally moved in to place. Her last chance to show that she hasn’t lost her nursing skills as she prepared to remove the 20 clips holding my wound together.\nShe was very good at it – with only one or two actually hurting. Tomorrow sees the start of partial weight bearing. 25% to begin with, though I’ve no idea how I am going to measure that. If you see me hobbling towards the centre of Whaley Bridge, I’ve probably gone too far!\nWell, Saturday morning and a quiet start to the day with Sally catching up with the entire world on Facebook. My main aim today is to start putting weight through my left leg. Its not easy, with tightness in the calf, tightness in the hamstring, and a reluctance to let go. The clip free wound is holding up well, and with some self massaging (in my calf you naughty people) its getting a bit easier."}

Though desperate to enjoy the status of a celebrated writer, the last thing he is actually prepared to do is sit down and write. His antics and rituals satirically showcase the many ironies of life set against the backdrop of the entertainment industry—Quincy’s own identity, the greatest parody. As an egomaniac with an inferiority complex, Quincy unabashedly self-promotes the legacies of his father, Mickey Rose, the venerated comedy writer; and godfather, Woody Allen, the prolific American filmmaker, as his own.\nQRS episodes explore the bizarre irreverence of Quincy’s perception. That is, how he sincerely feels entitled to fame, validation and success and would interrupt your mother’s funeral, in the most tasteful of ways, were it the only marketplace for his ideas. Quincy’s ability to self-aggrandize with great magnitude is a quality equally his greatest strength and weakness.\nAlong for the misadventures are Quincy’s friends, Nicky and James. Nicholas Brendon, as “Nicky,” plays an exaggerated version of himself: an out-of-work actor constantly seeking re-invention, yet unwilling to renounce his seven seasons and 147 episodes of dramatic triumph on “Buffy The Vampire Slayer.” James Hyde, as “James,” plays a gorgeous, but not so bright, wealth of bad information, insights and distorted ideas. Together, the trio descends to any low, uncovers any privacy, disregards any sanctity in a moral endeavor to serve what they believe most important: their own best interests.\nFOR SALE: The Quincy Rose Show - an original comedy with a clean chain of title!"}

Along the way, the partnership has worked to scale up poverty-fighting distribution, supply chain and training center enterprises in Latin America, India and sub-Saharan Africa.\nCreated through a $100 million donation to the Clinton Foundation from Canadian mining billionaire Frank Giustra, CGEP is a nonprofit that’s not interested in nonprofit or CSR plays. Rather, it supports enterprises looking to create profits within four years, and reinvests the returns into other enterprises in its portfolio. In each deal, it looks for social returns, including long-term income for beneficiaries relative to the size of the investment, among other factors.\nIn the latest NextBillion Podcast, I chatted with Mark Gunton, who has served as CEO of the partnership since 2012. Before joining the Clinton Foundation, Gunton was managing director-Americas, Middle East and Africa for TNT Express. He also helped found the Northstar Alliance, a network of roadside clinics across Africa.\nCGEP has looked to bridge those market gaps in the supply or distribution chains by developing partnerships between investee companies and large corporations, including Unilever.\nGunton also talks about the partnership’s approach to scaling enterprises, some mistakes it made early on, and his concerns about how social entrepreneurship is practiced today. While he says he respects many social entrepreneurs, he’s concerned by their limitations when it comes to achieving scale and replicating models, especially when they’re led by a single, visionary social entrepreneur.\nThis is a pivotal time for CGEP. The Clinton Foundation has been the subject of intense scrutiny from the news media and politicians during this presidential campaign, and significant scrutiny has been directed at CGEP as well. Giustra recently announced that if Hillary Clinton wins the U.S. presidential election, CGEP will be spun off from the Clinton Foundation and managed independently. Gunton also discusses how the partnership might look and function differently after the election in this wide-ranging discussion.\nTop image: Mark Gunton visits CGEP portfolio firm Chakipi, an inclusive distribution business in Peru, which empowers low-income women to become last-mile entrepreneurs in their communities through training, a broad basket of products, and microcredit.

If we are able to acquire this information, we could work to find a path which contains the administrator's preferred mailbox placement that also shortens the total driving distance - a win for everyone.\nOur class will spend two 90 minute class periods this week finishing up modeling work and coming to a class consensus on the optimal path. I will post the findings as they become available.\nPosted in PBL: Problem Based Learning on October 13, 2013 by Shelby Aaberg."}
{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "What are the causes and risk factors of prolonged grief?\nThe risk factors for experiencing more serious symptoms of grief for a longer period of time can be related to the survivor’s own physical and emotional health before the loss, the relationship between the bereaved and their family member or other loved one, as well as related to the nature of the death. For example, it is not uncommon for surviving loved ones who had a contentious or strained relationship, or otherwise unresolved issues with the deceased to suffer severe feelings of grief. Parents who have lost their child are at a significantly higher risk of divorce compared to couples who have not. They are also at increased risk for a decline in emotional health, including being psychiatrically hospitalized following the loss. This is a particular risk for mothers who have lost a child.\nBereaved individuals who either feel the death of their loved one is unexpected or violent may be at greater risk for suffering from major depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or complicated grief. Major depression is a psychiatric disorder characterized by depression and/or irritability that lasts at least two weeks in a row and is accompanied by a number of other symptoms, like problems with sleep, appetite, weight, concentration, or energy level and may also lead to the sufferer experiencing unjustified guilt, losing interest in activities he or she used to enjoy, or thoughts of wanting to kill themselves or someone else.\nPTSD refers to a condition that involves the sufferer enduring an experience that significantly threatened their sense of safety or well being (for example, the suicide or homicide of a loved one), then re-experiencing the event through nightmares or flashbacks (feeling as if the trauma is happening again at times when the sufferer is awake), developing a hypersensitivity to events that are normal (for example, being quite irritable, getting startled very easily, having trouble sleeping, or difficulty trusting others), and avoiding things that remind the person of the traumatic event (for example, people, places, or things that the sufferer may associate with the death of their loved one). Being able to care for a dying loved one tends to promote the healing process for those who are left behind. That care can either be provided at home, in the hospital, or in hospice care. Hospice is a program or facility that provides special care for people whose health has declined to the point that they are near the end of their life. Such programs or facilities also provide special care for their families.\nWhat are the signs, symptoms, and stages of grief?\nin her 1969 book titled On Death and Dying.\nShe described the stage of denial as the bereaved having difficulty believing what has happened, the anger phase as the survivor questioning the fairness of the loss, the bargaining stage as wishing to make a deal with fate to gain more time with the one who was lost.\nThe depression stage as the period when the bereaved person gets in touch with how very sad they are about losing their loved one, and acceptance as feeling some resolution to their grief and more ability to go on with their own life.\nKübler-Ross apparently felt these phases can be applied to any significant personal loss (for example, of a job, relationship, one’s own health, anticipating one’s own death), as well as the death of a loved one.\nIt also seems that she believed these stages don’t all have to occur, can take place in different order.\nGrief can reoccur many times as part of an individual’s specific grief process.\nThe shock or disbelief stage is understood as the numbness often associated with initially receiving the news of the death of a loved one. The guilt stage of grief refers to feelings of regret about difficult aspects of the relationship with the deceased.\nIn addition to the emotional pain already discussed, symptoms of grief can be physical, social, cultural, or religious in nature. Physical symptoms can range from mild sleep or appetite problems to heart attack. Social symptoms of bereavement include isolation from other loved ones and difficulty functioning at home, school, and/or at work.\nFor children and adolescents, reactions to the death of a parent or other loved one tend to be consistent with their reaction to any severe stress. Such reactions usually reflect the particular developmental stage of the child or adolescent. For example, since infants up to about 2 years of age cannot yet talk, their reaction to the loss of a loved one tends to involve crying and being more irritable. They further show physical symptoms of sleep or appetite problems, changes in activity level, and being more watchful of (vigilant toward) their surroundings.\nSince preschoolers from 3 to 5 years of age begin to be able to remember the one who died but have not yet developed the ability to understand the permanence of death, they may believe they somehow magically caused the death and can make the person come back. In addition to showing signs of grief that are similar to infants, they may have more difficulty separating from caregivers.\nEarly school-aged children, from 6 to 8 years of age, more likely understand that death is permanent compared to younger children, often feel guilt about the death of the loved one, become preoccupied with memories about the departed, and try to master the loss they have suffered by talking about it frequently. While symptoms of grief in school-aged children from 9 to 11 years of age are quite similar to those of early school-aged children, this older group is more vulnerable to a decrease in self-esteem because they feel different from their peers if they have experienced the loss of a loved one. They are also more prone to defend against their feelings of loss by becoming engrossed in school, social, and/or extracurricular activities.\nIn keeping with their budding need for independence, young adolescents 12 to 14 years of age may experience mixed feelings about the deceased individual and exhibit a wide range of emotions. They may avoid talking about the loss. Older teens usually experience grief similarly to adults, enduring sadness, anxiety, and anger. They tend to deny their feelings of loss to parents but discuss them in detail with peers. For children, adolescents, and adults, as with any major stress, grief may cause a person to regress emotionally, in that they go back to former, often less mature ways of thinking, behaving, and coping.\nSymptoms of complicated grief include intense emotion and longings for the deceased, severely intrusive thoughts about the lost loved one, extreme feelings of isolation and emptiness, avoiding doing things that bring back memories of the departed, new or worsened sleeping problems, and having no interest in activities that the sufferer used to enjoy. Teens tend to react to the loss of a loved one that died through suicide similarly to the ways in which adults experience complicated grief.\nRegardless of age, individuals who lose a loved one from suicide are more at risk for becoming preoccupied with the reason for the suicide while wanting to deny or hide the cause of death, wondering if they could have prevented it, feeling blamed for the problems that preceded the suicide, feeling rejected by their loved one, and stigmatized by others."}

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "Last week, my daughter came home commenting about a new bathroom rule at her school: all girls now have to use the restroom 2 at a time due to the fact that girls keep writing on the bathroom walls. As a teacher, I understand why the rule was implemented. As a parent, I understand why she feels frustrated.\nSince she just recently asked me to help her set up her own “real blog” (ie, can be read by a real audience), I asked her how she would feel about blogging on the subject. She took to that idea right away — especially once we figured out the speech-to-text feature so she didn’t have to keep fretting about spelling (teacher note: I really like the way speech-to-text requires the kids to pause & reflect to figure out exactly how they will verbalize each sentence).\nOnce she had her post written, “Fair School,” I, of course, went ahead and shared it with my PLN.\nThis has also led to a lot of discussion about how we can inspire people to do good things rather than just try to get them to stop doing bad things. Not an easy task for anyone, that’s for sure, but a very rewarding approach!\nOnce again, I have found this whole experience to positively reinforce the concepts of digital citizenship, flattened classroom walls, and #StudentVoice. When we provide opportunities for students to share their authentic voices on things that matter to them, powerful learning happens.\nAgain, I love this Mary. In fact, it has inspired me to start publishing student-voice pieces on my own blog. Thank you, and Lizzie, for sharing this.\nThat’s awesome, Monte!! I will definitely watch for those–I’m always inspired by the student pieces my PLN shares, especially when it’s clear those kids have been taught that their. voice. MATTERS! It’s apparent that they recognize the gravity of the words they share.\nLizzie’s post was the best thing I read all week. Well done to you too, Mary.\nI was wondering about how she wrote the text. Voice to text is amazing. I’ve had students in the past who were incredible storytellers, but didn’t see themselves as writers because they struggled with the writing (ASD, Dysgraphia, Dyslexia etc). Such a powerful tool and great use of technology in schools.\nI hope the solution all works out!\nThanks, Abe! It was a little tricky because the Weebly app does not have that little microphone button on the keyboard that most other apps do. I showed her how she could overcome that by writing the text in a Google Keep note, and then copying/pasting over to the Weebly app. I also showed her how to verbalize the punctuation. It took some support, but I think kids in the classroom could definitely handle it, as well! Such a great tool for differentiation!"}

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "1- It is quoted from most Islamic scholars as follows: \"they should recite the formula of endowment for a piece of land to make it as masjid, like (I endow it as masjid for the sake of Allah). However, according to the stronger view it suffices to make it a masjid if they build it as a masjid for the sake of Allah and a person say a prayer in it with the permission of the sponser.\n2- De facto deed in endowing as a masjid is sufficient provided that his aim in construction is its construction/renovation as a masjid, specialy when one constructs a building on an ownerless piece of land. While if one has a house/shop, intends it to be a masjid and forces people to say their prayer there, it is problematic to suffice like that without reciting the formula of endowment deed.\n3- After being built as a masjid it does not belong to a specific nationality, group, tribe, or individuals, and it is permissible for all Muslims to make use of it.\n4- If it is not known that the masjid’s water is endowed to be used for wuḍū’ only by those who want to perform prayer, and in the masjid’s area the neighbors and passers-by usually use such water, there will be no problem in it, although observing caution in this regard is preferred.\n5- One should avoid those acts which are not compatible with standing and prestige of a masjid like sport and related exercises.\n6- There is no problem in having classes on Qur’an, practical laws of Islam, Islamic ethics and practicing religious and revolutionary songs in a masjid. But it is obligatory to show appropriate respect for the status, sacredness, and position of the masjid and it is impermissible to annoy and disturb the praying persons.\n7- There is no problem in broadcasting the adhān in a usual and common way by means of a loudspeaker to announce the beginning of the time of prayer. But there is a problem in, broadcasting Qur’anic verses, supplication, and the likes using a loudspeaker in the masjid when it annoys the neighbors.\n8- It is ḥarām to make the ground,ceiling, wall, and roof of a masjid najis. If they become najis, one should purify them right away.\n9- If a masjid is usurped, destroyed, abandoned and another building is constructed on its land or no sign of being masjid remained due to being abandoned and there is no hope for its renovation like in a case that there is no settlement/village in vicinity any more, it is not certain that it is ḥarām to make it najis.\n10- Decorating a masjid with gold is ḥarām if it is considered as extravagance; otherwise, it is makrūh.\n11- According to shar‘,non-Muslims should not enter Masjid al-Ḥarām. If their entrance to other masjids is considered to entail disgrace and disrespect to the sanctity of the masjid, it is, also impermissible; in general, they should not enter any masjid.\n12- For a menstruating woman or if she is experiencing nifās ('bleeding after delivery') and a person in state of janābah, it is ḥarām to enter Masjid al-Ḥarām. It is also ḥarām for them to stay in other masjids. Rather, this rule is applied to their entering other masjids except for the following cases which are no problem: one passes through the masjid by entering from a door and exiting from another door or he/she wants to take something from the masjid. By obligatory caution, the same rules are applied to the shrines of the Infallible Imams (a). It is more compatible with caution to apply the rules of Masjid al-Ḥarām and those of Masjid al- Nabawī to these shrines.\n13- It is mustaḥabb to build a masjid or renovate a masjid which is going to be destroyed. If it is destroyed in a way that it is impossible to repair it, they may destroy it completely to make a new one in its place. Rather, they may destroy a masjid which is in good conditions to replace it with a larger one to fulfill the people's need.\n14- It is mustaḥabb to clean a masjid. For a person who wants to go to a masjid, it is mustaḥabb to wear perfume and good clean clothes, be careful that his shoes and feet are not dirty/impure, to enter the masjid sooner, and to exit later, than others, and at the time of entering/exiting the masjid to say dhikr and have humble heart.\n15- It is mustaḥabb to say a two-rak'ah prayer as reverence and greeting to the masjid. In this regard, it suffices to say any other mustaḥabb/wājib prayer.\n16- The merits of performing prayer in a masjid are applicable to women as well.\n17- It is mustaḥabb to provide the masjid with light and to sweep it, to enter the masjid in a state of wuḍū’, and with the right foot and to exit the masjid with the left foot. Having enterd the masjid, it is mustaḥabb to face qiblah, to supplicate to Allah, to praise and thank Him and to recite salawāt.\n18- It is mustaḥabb to say prayer in masjids. Rather it is makrūh not to go to a masjid without any excuse like raining, specially for the masjid's neighbours. It is narrated in a tradition: \" there is no prayer for a neighbor of a masjids unless in the masjid\". The most virtueous masjid is Masjid al-Ḥarām, then Masjid al-Nabawī, then Masjid Kūfeh, then Masjid al-Aqsā, then masjid jāmi', then masjid of one's tribe, and then the market masjid.\n19- To build a masjid is among emphesized mustaḥabb acts and results in huge reward. It is narrated from the Holy Prophet (S.A.W): \"Whoever build a masjid in this world, Allah will compensate for each span – or he said for each cubit – of it a city (as long as a distace to be covered during forty thousand years) of gold, silver, pearls, rubies, emeralds, aquamarines and beryls\".\n20- The following acts are makrūh in a masjid: to sleep unless one has no other choice, to talk about worldly affairs, industrial works, to recite a poam unless it contains an advice or the like, to drop saliva, mucus from chest/nose, to shout and search for a lost person/property. However, there is no problem in saying adhān loudly in a masjid.\n21- To allow a mad to enter a masjid is makrūh. It is makrūh for a person who has eaten onion/garlic or the like and his mouth smell bothers people to go to a masjid.\n22- To abandon a masjid unused is makrūh. According to a tradition, the masjid is one of the three complainants who make a complain to Allah, the sublime, on the Ressurection, the second is a scholar among ignorants and the third the Holy Qor'an on which there is dust and is not recited. It is narrated that: \"Whoever goes to a masjid will get ten rewards, ten faults will be removed from his acts, and is promoted ten grades for any step he walks to the masjid and returns\".\n23- To say dead prayer in a masjid other than Masjid al-Ḥarām is makrūh."}

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "Maybe it was an unusually heated election or less-than-thrilling matchups but decline in game viewership signals big changes are underway, writes the founder and CEO of GlassView.\nWe all know that TV audiences have been on a steady decline, but the NFL was the rare exception that proved the rule. Until this year, that is.\nRatings for this year's matchups have been down across the board and in double digits in some cases. While this might be a function of an unusually heated presidential election and some less-than-thrilling games, more likely this is just what you'd expect in the early stages of an industry changeover in which TV advertising is dethroned by digital.\nOn the one hand, the average American spends 70 minutes a day consuming digital video and, with 213.6 million viewers, digital video is close to catching up with TV for overall viewership. For those consumers, TV is merely another device to view video, and that's rapidly becoming the case for everyone.\nProgrammatic TV will start to come into its own. With no election spending on the horizon in 2017, broadcasters will be forced to embrace changes in the marketplace they were able to ignore in 2016. One is the slow and steady rise of programmatic TV. Though addressable advertising is still probably years off, the industry is starting to put in place a mechanism that will let marketers buy TV the way they buy digital media and to place buys across both simultaneously. Broadcasters still need to overcome hurdles like a lack of uniform pricing, KPIs and media-buying platforms, but they will make progress this year.\nCross-device targeting will become more refined. By cross-referencing a user's IP address with other cached IP addresses associated with a mobile device, you can usually assume that you're targeting the same user across devices. This is still a fairly new capability, but in 2017 we'll see marketers start to play with variables like frequency and sequencing. During the holidays, for instance, a marketer might want to hit a user with more generalized messages during the day but then use a call-to-action message at night when the consumer is in buying mode and on her tablet.\nTV and digital video will become more alike. We are used to hearing how digital is eating the world. However, it's also true that digital marketers can learn much from TV advertising as well. Marketers are realizing that TV advertising has always been and can be very effective in brand building. They also are learning that serendipitous messaging has its benefits. Your ad may not be hitting the right target, but the ad might get some resonance anyway. For instance, a viewer might not be in the market for the product you're selling, but might think it's perfect for someone they know and buy it as a gift. Broadcast TV will continue to apply learnings from digital as well, but next year, marketers will find an appreciation for the virtues of TV too.\nIoT will continue to develop as a niche market. Of course there's a chance that this could be a breakthrough year for IoT. The more likely scenario though is that this will continue to be a niche market, hovering well below the one percent range. Still, savvy companies will put their stakes in the ground, as IoT inevitably becomes part of consumers' daily lives. This is likely a 2020s technology, but 2017 is a good time to start laying a groundwork for the future.\nThis combination of refined targeting on multiple devices will let marketers spread their messages in ways that are both more targeted and more intimate. Marketers know that video is the most effective mode of sending a message with emotional impact. What they might not know is that the palette for that messaging is about to expand in a big way."}

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "It’s Pride Month and nearly a year has passed since my essay, “How Not To Be Seen: Unlearning Invisibility,” was first published here on Haute Macabre. So lately I’ve been doing a lot of reflecting on that particular piece of writing which, to my surprise and subsequent joy, ended up helping more people than myself alone. I find it hard to believe that it has only been one year. In some ways it feels so much longer than that. Day-to-day life has simply been busy, to be sure, but I think it’s also because my life is richer for being more open and honest, for feeling more visible, less burdened, more comfortable in my own skin, for feeling seen and supported.\nIt might surprise some to learn that one of the best things that’s happened over the last year is that I’ve grown even closer to B, my cis male primary partner. He’s been my best friend for decades and we’ve been partners for…well, it’ll be 17 years this December. One of the things I tried to express in my essay was that coming out and living life as honestly as possible has been challenging for both of us. But we were willing to put our hearts on the line and put in the emotional work, even when it sometimes seemed endless. One year later, I can say with confidence that we’ve both learned even more about ourselves, each other, and about us as a couple and we’re stronger, more vulnerable, and closer for it. I’m even more grateful for B’s presence, his steadfast love, and his unwavering support. In case anyone is wondering, I’m no less queer now than I was this time last year, but, for as much as I’ve struggled to be seen and understood, I’ve also learned that B is a vital part of that visibility, not independent of it or complementary to it. Yes, it’s complicated, but that’s okay.\nThis isn’t meant to imply that the past year has been all ups and no downs, far from it. There’s been both love and loss. Hearts afire, heartache, and heartbreak. But, truth be told, I wouldn’t have it any other way. I’ve learned so much. I’m still learning. I imagine I always will be. That’s okay too. That’s more than okay.\nBut the most important thing that came of sharing that essay – besides the wealth of support I received from people I already knew and people I didn’t know until they reached out – was that it turned out to be much bigger than myself, a discovery which also helped me feel less isolated and despairing. Shortly after the essay was posted I began hearing from people who felt that, to one extent or another, my words had voiced their own experiences, desires, and worries, their own internal conflict, and the pains of invisible existence. I received such intensely moving and candid messages, e-mails, and letters that, as its anniversary approaches, I want to share the essay here again (you’ll find it below), in hopes that it’ll reach more people who might benefit from the cathartic paragraphs I loosed onto the internets one year ago. If you’re one of those people and you’d like to talk with me about your own situation, please do. I want you to feel seen and heard, valid and loved.\nIn a few moments it’ll officially be my birthday. I’m home alone, sipping bourbon, and re-watching Only Lovers Left Alive. It’s both Pride month and the month in which I turn 40, but I don’t feel like celebrating. That’s because it’s Pride month and I’m about to turn 40 and I feel as though, with the exception of a few precious people and despite what it says in my bio at the bottom of this page, my everyday life is more or less lived in the closet. It’s a closet built of my own silence and other people’s assumptions, but closets of convenience are no less suffocating. So how did I get here?\nLike many queer kids, I was a late bloomer. I knew from very early on that I wasn’t straight and that it felt like the most natural thing in the world, but I had no vocabulary for it. When I look back on my childhood and adolescence, there were an abundance of wonderful queer influences in my life – writers, actors, artists, musicians – that I didn’t appreciate specifically for their queerness at the time, but I believe had an impact all the same. Speaking of Only Lovers Left Alive, I’m by no means the first person to declare a profound crush on beguiling, inspiring, gender-fluid Tilda Swinton, who’s had me in her thrall since I first saw Orlando in my teens, which was also how I discovered Virginia Woolf. I’m doubly glad about these queer presences because I didn’t have any queer personal contacts until I was nearly out of high school. If any of my friends at the time were somehow queer, they weren’t out (not that I’m blaming anyone for that). I had no gay relatives or gay family friends (again, not that I knew of). I was also introverted, melancholy, and often lost in my own head, which probably didn’t help matters.\nI don’t recall hearing overtly homophobic rhetoric from anyone close to me as a child. But I remember lots of little things, like kids in school making homophobic jokes, laughing and reciting sing-song chants on the playground like “Lez be friends so we can walk homo together.” I doubt they really understood what they were saying, not at that age. They just thought it was funny. But these sorts of things made it clear to me that certain people were considered “other”, that girls crushed on boys and boys crushed on girls and eventually they’d all grow up and get married and have kids and it was all very, very heteronormative.\nCome adolescence I knew I was queer, but still lacked a vocabulary for it. I knew what turned my head and captivated me, but hadn’t the first idea what to do about it or have anyone in whom I felt I could confide about such things. Everyone else seemed to be getting along as well or poorly as can be expected in their teenage years, because let’s not forget that adolescence is rough for everyone. I developed crushes on girls and boys my age (in retrospect, the boys tended to be pretty and delicate of feature), but I didn’t date anyone until college. The internet was a nascent thing during my teens. Life was pre-Facebook, pre-Instagram, pre-Tumblr, etc. I appreciate and sometimes actively envy the access adolescents now have to information, support resources, and potential friends, both near and far. It’s a pointless exercise, but I can’t help wondering if I would’ve figured myself out much earlier if I’d had the access to such things when I was a teen.\nCollege finally introduced me to all sorts of openly queer people. I made new friends and met people I fancied and sometimes they fancied me back, fancy that! Unfortunately, college also brought an abusive relationship with a man and later I was raped by another. I told no one about either of these things at the time and eventually dropped out of college and got a job. I dated women and men and, a couple years later, I was assaulted again, this time by a woman. The world closed a little more each time I experienced this sort of harm, perhaps even more so because I didn’t reach out to others for help. Instead I did what I’d always done and tried to keep going in spite of things, but life became increasingly tricky to navigate. Self-loathing increased, self-esteem shrank, and who I was became less important than simply keeping my head above water.\nOver time life gradually calmed down and stabilized. I moved out to Seattle in my mid-twenties, having wanted to live in the PNW since I was a teen. There I formed a deep, healthy, loving relationship with a warm and kind-hearted cis man with whom I’d been friends since college and who is now my husband (I’ll call him B). I also landed a great job for a singular company which grew into the position I love today.\nSo much of my 20s were varying degrees of difficult and personally unstable. By the time I reached 30 it was clear to me that I needed outside help to deal with various things I’d never actually addressed. Counseling was a life-saving source of support and guidance, helping me face and work through events and issues from my past, letting go of destructive coping mechanisms I’d developed over the intervening years, and learning how to accept, rebuild, and love myself.\nBut what never came up (nor did I bring up) in therapy or in conversations with my closest friends or even with B, perhaps because it was simply still higher up yet on my personal hierarchy of needs, were my sexual identity and relationship needs. This isn’t meant to imply that B wasn’t aware of my sexual history. We’d discussed it years ago and I’d described myself as what felt accurate at the time: as someone whose attractions to people didn’t concern gender, but individuals. I think that was genuinely was true for a period and remains true with regards to B, but I also can’t help but look back and consider the pressures of heteronormativity and relationship conventions, and how it was easier for me, especially while I was broken and unstable, to default to social norms. Regardless, sexuality is a spectrum, everyone has different relationship needs, and people also grow and change throughout their lives, myself included.\nIt was only once I finally began to feel okay with myself that I became increasingly aware of both a growing absence in my life and and sense of invisibility. Somewhere along the way of struggling to keep from completely falling apart I’d lost my sense of queerness, and the prospect of facing this felt like the scariest thing yet. Now I found myself married (albeit happily) to a man and thus presenting for all intents and purposes as a heterosexual woman. I’m in my 30s and have a loving partner who is also my best friend. I love my job. I love where I live. Life should be great. I repeatedly told myself it was too late and felt too selfish to even be considering such things. I was lucky to have as much as I did. I should’ve realized and said something to B years ago. I’d missed my window. And at the time, in the midst of all these worries and rationalizations, I didn’t even stop to consider the heteronormative privilege I experience passing as straight. Instead I’d swallow my concerns and longings, shove it all down and ignore it in hopes of forgetting about it, because thinking about it, let alone talking about it, felt pointless.\nBut as time passes it becomes impossible to ignore that it’s not pointless, that it’s not okay to feel like this, increasingly not okay on many levels. It affects my general well-being, my day-to-day life. It affects the quality of my relationship with B. I lose interest in my hobbies. The idea of spending time with friends feels exhausting because it means keeping up the appearance that I feel fine. Exchanging everyday pleasantries makes me scream and sob inside. I feel hollow interacting with a world that assumes I’m straight, that I’m not a member of the LGBTQ+ community, but an ally. I lose sleep at night wondering if I’ll ever even kiss another woman again and preoccupied by the profound despair such thoughts bring. I silently seethe while sitting through conversations with friends or family that disturb or offend me and feel mute because, before I can address an offending topic, I’d have to start potentially awkward conversations about myself in order to discuss said topic without seeming like someone getting offended on behalf of someone else. It all feels so complicated and messy. So much of this is my fault. I know this. I’m a natural introvert with an intense dislike of confrontation. I don’t want to make people I care about feel uncomfortable and I’m scared of alienating people in my life by sharing information I’ve been sitting on for so long it now feels like an old, increasingly dangerous bomb that only I know about, that only I can see.\nOn the verge of a tangible internal breaking point, I did finally confide in a couple close friends and, from there, worked up the courage to talk with B. It was terrifying and very emotional for both of us and didn’t get easier from there. There was relief at first, yes, but then began the long, steep learning curve as we set about navigating an entirely new phase of our relationship, one of ethical non-monogamy. For anyone considering such a thing themselves – coming out to your partner and opening your relationship – it’s a lot of hard work that requires constant open communication. But it’s completely worthwhile, I think, especially if you know your life is on the line. But, yes, it means lots of challenging conversations with your partner and working through all sorts of worries, insecurities, and other issues as they arise. For me it also means making sure B understands that, even though I’m a lot gayer now than when we began dating, I don’t love him any less or feel less romantically connected to him because he and our connection are just that special to me.\nWhile this was tremendous personal progress and progress as a couple, aside from B and I each confiding in a couple close friends, the change in our relationship was kept a secret. There was to be no outward evidence so as not to invite potentially awkward questions, not because of shame, but because of convenience.\nDuring this period I met a woman who she initially seemed wonderful in all sorts of ways and I felt swept off my feet, but ultimately it didn’t work out for us. I try to remind myself that most relationships don’t, regardless of things like sexuality or relationship philosophy. Perhaps, because things with B were then so delicate, and fraught, that new relationship was doomed from the start. I think that’s part of it. Sharply differing life circumstances were another. It turned out to be an impossible situation in myriad ways. I’m abbreviating and oversimplifying the entire thing for the sake of everyone’s privacy and the ache in my heart, but (also oversimplifying) I am forever grateful that it happened at all, because for so long I didn’t think anything even remotely of the sort would ever be possible for me.\nI’d also like to add – not that this is news in the history of queer love – that one of the worst things ever is experiencing profound heartbreak and grieving the end of a relationship without being able to tell anyone about it because, once again, that means first having a host of other awkward conversations and you’re too sad and fragile to even begin to consider wanting to bother. So you go about the rest of your life as you’ve so often done, behaving as though everything is fine, when all you’re doing when you’re alone is crying. The. Worst.\nWhat do you do when you finally come to fully appreciate who you are in your late 30s but your life is otherwise pretty much set? As as result of my relationship with B and because I present as very femme, there’s little outward evidence of who I know I am: a lesbian. Some might want classify me as bisexual or homoflexible because of my committed, romantic relationship with a cis man, but those labels don’t feel right to me. B and I love each other, he’s a vital part of my life, but he’s also something of an exception in my otherwise gay existence. I’ve gone through periods of fretting I’ll be told I’m somehow not queer enough to identify as I do, but I know down to my core that I’m a lesbian and I don’t care what anyone else thinks about this or that label or how my intimate relationships might be used to argue otherwise.\nThat being said, I don’t know what to do with these levels of invisibility. Both my straight and queer friends take it for granted that I’m straight, so when do I just…tell them I’m not? And to what end? Just so they know? So that I’m seen? Am I over-thinking this? It still feels selfish and self-important. Shouldn’t it be good enough that I finally know who I am? I’ve tried to tell myself as much time and again, but it never lasts long. I’ve also never found a good moment for such conversations. And it’s not that I’m worried my friends might be unsupportive either, at least not regarding my sexual identity. I know the concept of ethical non-monogamy is still quite a challenging concept for some, but my need to live a complete, honest, and open life is now so great, the idea of convenient discretion feels like a burden. But it simply doesn’t come up, nor do I bring it up. I stay quiet and grow increasingly sad and uncomfortable in my own life. And on those occasional really low, dark days, where I feel like my very being exists unexpressed, I begin to understand how some people reach a point where they’d simply rather not be at all, which is a horrible state of mind.\nThen there’s the curious plight of the invisible femme. Not recognized as who you are. Unsure if you’re recognizing other queer women. Assuming you’re probably mistaken about them. Afraid to offend or upset anyone, because that makes rejection feel even scarier. I also worry about being rejected, seen as unavailable or outright undesirable simply because of my relationship status. Closed off and invisible like this, I don’t know how to meet new potential partners.\nAll of this is how I come to find myself writing such a rambling, emotional essay on my birthday, because at this point I just need to get it all out, like an owl pellet. Because I realize there are different sorts of invisible closets in life and I’m tired, starved, and heartsick from being inside any of them. Because perhaps there’s even one person out there in a similar situation who might read this and decide it’s not too late for them to be true to themselves so they won’t wait as long as I did. Because I want to be told it’s not too late for me either. Because I don’t want to feel mournful envy when I see women together. Because I don’t want to feel like a vital part of my identity is a secret I need to discretely tend to, unbeknownst to friends and family, because that’s not actually tending to anything. Because I know I have so much more love to give. Because I want to be seen and I want to be part of the community I’ve felt largely divorced from for much too long. Where are you, my queer, dark, witchy peers? We need to support each other.\nI commented on your original post a couple of months ago and wanted to do so at your repost as well. So much of this resonates: being married to a cis straight male and unsure how to be or come out with anyone. I see you."}

In fact, the value of care provided by unpaid informal caregivers is estimated at $306 billion annually. Sadly, many of the over 39 million Americans who provide care to elderly family members themselves suffer from poor health. The strain of caring for frail or disabled relatives often results in emotional, physical and mental health problems for the caregiver.\nTo recognize and reward caregivers who often put their own needs last, national nonprofit Twilight Wish Foundation and Parentgiving created the “Caring for the Caregiver” award. Twilight Wish and Parentgiving are excited to announce that Claudette Tuttle of Riverhead, New York has been chosen as the winner of the contest, coinciding with the celebration of National Caregivers Month in November.\nTuttle, 65, has been caring for her 92-year-old bedridden mother, Alice, since 2000. She is responsible for all daily care of her mother, takes her to all her doctor appointments and keeps track of all her medications, continuing even after she herself suffered a terrible fall five years ago that left her with a broken sternum and debilitating pain in her hip and back. It was only two years ago that Tuttle who worked for the Riverhead Central School District for 22 years, 13 of them as a full-time bus driver, retired, while continuing to provide care for her mother. In March 2013, a devastating fire destroyed her family home and all her possessions. Tuttle’s beloved pets, two dogs, a puppy and several cats, also died in the tragic fire. Luckily, Tuttle escaped injury as did her mother who was staying in a small cottage on the property. Tuttle was nominated by her sister, Nancy Hansen of Stratham, New Hampshire for her dedication to caring for their mother, despite all her own hardships. Tuttle and a friend will get her wish of going to the Christmas Spectacular show at Radio City Music Hall, followed by dinner in Manhattan, while her sister takes care of their mother for the day.\nThe Allegheny County chapter of Twilight Wish Foundation, Western Pennsylvania, was the recipient of a generous donation from Highland Park Care Center. Marianne Pisano, the administrator of Highland Park, recently presented a check for $500 to Lisa Dalena of the Allegheny County chapter. Highland Park also donated Lexus Club Pirates tickets for a wish earlier this year.\nTwilight Wish Foundation and Parentgiving know how much hard work and dedication are needed to provide care for an elderly loved one. We also understand how stressful and time-consuming it can be. Many caregivers often put themselves last and struggle with their own physical, mental and financial needs. To recognize the selflessness of caregivers, we created the Caring for the Caregiver award. One lucky caregiver will receive a getaway of their choice: a two-night hotel stay, tickets to a show or event, restaurant meal(s), or a relaxing spa treatment(s). While they relax, a local senior homecare organization will provide professional in-home non-medical senior care services for the winning caregiver’s loved one, ensuring them a worry-free getaway.

A recent graduate of the University of Notre Dame and an alumnae of St. Mary’s College, Fleshman, 23, was very involved with campus ministry and often performed music at masses for the Sisters of the Holy Cross who reside on campus. Fleshman grew close to many of the women there, especially Sister Marilla Dyer, 92. For Sister Marilla’s birthday last September, Fleshman surprised her with a ticket to the Notre Dame-Purdue football game and pushed her in a wheelchair all the way from St. Mary’s to Notre Dame to attend the game.\n“It was one of the best days of my life,” said Fleshman. “And, it inspired me to want to grant wishes for the elderly.” However, as a busy college student, Fleshman had no idea how she could manage, much less afford, such an ambitious endeavor until she was crowned Miss Collegiate North in March. Her platform, “Shining Light through Twilight,” provides her the opportunity to help those seniors who have inspired her throughout her life. As chapter director, Fleshman will be making wishes come true for deserving seniors in Indiana, making our world a nicer place to age.\nhttps://twilightwish.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/logo-with-tagline2.png 0 0 Mary Farrell https://twilightwish.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/logo-with-tagline2.png Mary Farrell2013-07-03 14:24:492013-07-03 14:24:49Twilight Wish Opens Chapter in Indiana!\nTwilight Wish is excited to announce the appointment of Terese Klinger as director of the newly-formed Elburn, Illinois chapter of Twilight Wish Foundation.

For the summer I managed to persuade my better half she needed a new fridge so I could have the old one for conditioning my ale. Unfortunately it only takes one keg at a time, and due to very warm weather I’m having to ferment in it with it linked to my inkbird. At this moment in time I have at least two cornies, one dispensing, one conditioning at 24c! Using a bucket, cold water and ice blocks helps temporary, but I was thinking of a chest freezer linked up to my ic 308, big enough to take at least 3 cornies to solve the problem. My question is will a chest freezer designed to go down to -24c be okay to run at about 12c? It seems a logical solution if possible.\nRe: Keeping my beer cool in this heatwave!\nYes it will work fine. I do exactly this albeit with a smaller freezer. The only thing is that you're likely to get condensation forming in the freezer and you should have some mechanism to deal with it, even if that's just a couple of towels changed regularly.\nyou may also need to add a little height/depth to the freezer to accommodate disconnects and trailing beer/gas lines with a wooden collar, this also provides for more solid thru the wall tap points too.\nAs said above, it's fine. I used a small freezer to run my beer cooler at 12C (or so) for years.\nThanks for your help guys. I’ll try my luck on eBay first, but one I’ve seen and measured internally in Curry’s just allows three kegs and enough height for my disconnects.\nJust to let you know project finished, and well pleased with the outcome. Wish I had taken Fil’s advice to the letter, as not wanting to mess about making a collar I attempted to drill the sides very high up on the freezer to miss refrigeration pipes. BIG MISTAKE, one second hand freezer down the tip! After buying a another freezer off gumtree, I followed his advice.\nFor the sake of three or four hours and some wood and adhesive, job was relatively simple, and I’m drinking nice condition beer with just a pull of a faucet handle!\nTop Cat wrote: Thanks for your help guys.

I managed to get a second hand similar model in black.\nI thought by turning the freezer on and watching for condensation on the inside walls, I could locate where the refrigeration pipes were. Condensation seemed to stop about 4 inches from the top so by drilling above that level should be ok. I got away with drilling the side with two small holes, one for gas in and one for my temp sensor probe, but as soon as I put a larger hole for my faucet adapters in the front of the freezer, disaster struck and I hit a pipe.\nUnless you can find some way of finding out where these damn pipes are located, adding a collar is a no brainer. I agree with you Tom you were probably lucky!"}

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "This guest post is by Tom Cooney of a.tom.called.cooney.\nThe Bar-Kays first played together in 1966 as a backing band on Stax Records. There were 6 original band members; Jimmy King, Ronnie Caldwell, Phalon Jones, Carl Cunningham, Ben Cauley, and James Alexander. Just as their career was taking off King, Caldwell, Jones and Cunningham along with Otis Redding and his manager, were killed in a plane crash over Lake Monona. Cauley and Alexander were on a separate plane since there was only enough room for 8 passengers.\nAfter some time, the remaining members began to rebuild the band. They found success playing for Isaac Hayes on his albums “Hot Buttered Soul”, “Shaft”, “Movement” and “To Be Continued”. The Bar-Kays were immediately recognized as a band with a lot of talent and were eventually signed to Mercury Records.\nSoul Finger was released in 1967 and reached #3 on the R&B chart. Other hits include Son Of Shaft (1972), Shake Your Rump To The Funk (1976), Lets Have Some Fun (1978), Hit & Run (1981), and Freak Show on the Dance Floor (1984).\nMany hip hop artists have been influenced by The Bar-Kays such as; Cypress Hill, Ice Cube, De La Soul, Edan, Public Enemy, and The Beastie Boys.\nI first heard the Freak Show On The Dance Floor when it was featured in the movie “Breakin”. I thought the song was kind of cool, and the chorus was catchy. As I got older I was able to appreciate the talent of the entire band, both new and old members. Hit & Run is constantly in my playlist whenever I play out.\nThe Bar-Kays are still available for booking and will be playing at the Monterey Blues Festival on June 24th. They still put on a pretty dope show and are worth checking out if you get the chance."}
{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "Dyspnoea is a feeling of breathlessness that can be experienced by many people with advanced cancer or those with earlier-stage cancers who have other conditions that affect the heart or lungs. Distinct sensations include effort/work, chest tightness, and air hunger (the feeling of not enough oxygen).\nDyspnoea is a normal symptom of heavy exertion but becomes pathological if it occurs in unexpected situations. In 85% of cases it is due to Asthma, Pneumonia, Cardiac Ischemia, Interstitial Lung Disease, Congestive Heart Failure, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, or psychogenic causes such as Panic Disorder and Anxiety.\nAn individual with a potentially life-threatening blood clot or other emergency, for example, may experience dyspnoea. It is important to inform your child’s doctor immediately should your child experience any symptoms of Dyspnoea.\nIt is thought that three main components contribute to dyspnoea: afferent signals, efferent signals, and central information processing. It is believed the central processing in the brain compares the Afferent and Efferent signals; and dyspnoea results when a “mismatch” occurs between the two: such as when the need for ventilation (afferent signalling) is not being met by physical breathing (efferent signalling).\nA person may experience dyspnoea even though the actual levels of oxygen are within a normal range. It is important to understand that people do not suffocate or die from dyspnoea.\nDifferent physiological pathways may lead to shortness of breath including via ASIC chemoreceptors, mechanoreceptors, and lung receptors.\nWhile shortness of breath is generally caused by disorders of the cardiac or respiratory system, other systems such as Neurological, Musculoskeletal, Endocrine, Hematologic, and Psychiatric may be the cause.\nThe most common cardiovascular causes are acute myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure while common pulmonary causes include chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Asthma, Pneumothorax, Pulmonary Oedema and Pneumonia.\nDyspnoea may also be caused by a tumour or by other conditions related to cancer, and many of these causes are treatable.\n(3) An abnormality in the ventilatory system.\nTo learn more about your symptoms, the doctor will review your medical history and ask you to describe your symptoms and any activities or other medical conditions that make the symptoms worse.\nThe initial approach to evaluation begins by assessment of the airway, breathing, and circulation followed by a medical history and physical examination.\nA number of scales may be used to quantify the degree of shortness of breath such as The Modified Borg Scale in which breathlessness is rated on a scale from 1 to 10 with descriptors associated with the number.\nBlood Tests may also be helpful in determining the cause of shortness of breath, and your child’s doctor may also order a chest x-ray to confirm or rule out a Pneumothorax, Pulmonary Oedema, or Pneumonia.\nAn important step in managing dyspnoea is treating the cause, such as the tumour or a blood clot."}
{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "Would you put maple syrup in your car instead of gasoline? “But it tastes better!” Maybe so, but the car won’t run on maple syrup. In fact, you might end up ruining your car!\nLook around. That’s just what we (as a society) are doing. Filling our mouths with for that tastes good, but does not provide us with the nourishment we need. Food that ends up ruining the marvelous creation that God made.\nFood was meant to be fuel for the body. Food was intended to serve the body and provide it what it needs for optimal performance. But our society has completely inverted that formula. For many, the body is at the mercy of food. We are food-obsessed. The pleasure of our taste-buds has taken first priority, and nutrition and nourishment have taken a back seat (heck, they may even have been tossed out of the car by now)!\nJoin me in the fight against this obsession with food (our “food-session,” for short). Reclaim the body as God designed and intended. Reclaim food as fuel — as nourishment for your body — and not as the destroyer of God’s good creation. Reclaim God’s intended order that food is for the body not the other way around.\nIt’s going to be a tough fight. I have a 8-year-old and a 6-year-old. I tell them often that we eat for our bodies, not for our mouths. On certain days, I have them look at “My Healthy Plate” and tell me what categories of intake they are lacking for that day. Our kids are surrounded by more than junk food; they are bombarded by crap-food (pardon me). Sometimes it’s distressing, but all the more reason that we cannot give up the fight.\nWill you join me? There’s still time to make a difference and show our Lord that we really do value the very good creation He gave us.\nIf you ever wondered if God cared about the body, read Paul’s letters to the church in Corinth. Paul’s message is clear : It matters to God what we do with our bodies!\nIn doing so, He has given each of us a unique and individual gift (our own body) to grow and steward and care for every day of our lives.\nAnd He made it clear that it matters to Him how we care for it. For the nation of Israel, God gave many laws about what to eat, what not to eat; what to touch, what not to touch; when to work and when to rest. And for the church, Paul echoes the principle of devoting all of who we are to the Lord — that the body also matters in our devotion to God.\nSo as I aim to raise the value of returning health and fitness to the realm of the sacred, I constantly have to evaluate my own progress in that journey. And, as it is with the other aspects of ourselves that we devote to God (e.g., mind and soul), the process of devoting my body to God IS a journey. And real journeys generally do not go up and to the right all the time. Some seasons are better than others; some harder. Sometimes it’s two steps forwards and one step back. Sometimes it’s victory in one aspect with defeat in another. And my journey is the same. I just pray that it’s always moving forward….\nSo as you examine your life and your whole-life devotion, remember that God wants all of you. Don’t stop at considering just what might defile your soul, but also … as Paul reminds us … what might defile the body as well. And when things go wrong (because they do), don’t let the evil one use it to beat you down. Remember that God is the author of process … that Jesus understands our weakness … and victory has already been won for us (although we have yet to lay hold of it). Just get back up. Seek to learn what it is you need to learn, and never give up. In our weakness is His strength. We just need to find it.\nIf you are like me, you want to devote everything to Him. I like to say, “All of me, all for you.” That’s the goal, but I fall down. And God in His love and mercy responds to my cries for forgiveness and lovingly picks me up.\nSomeday I’ll get all the way there, but He will have brought me home by then. So until then, I’m in the process …."}

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "For NESB (Non English Speaking Background) students, the adjustments required to study successfully at a tertiary institution are varied and taxing (Myles & Cheng, 2003). Probably the greatest difficulty they encounter is overcoming the lack of the appropriate linguistic and cultural knowledge needed for meaningful interaction both in and outside the mainstream classroom (Myles & Cheng, 2003; Zou, 1998). In this article, we review research at our university investigating the challenges facing this cohort and their lecturers. This research indicates that many of these students have great difficulty with oral communication in English and are uneasy about interacting in groups, particularly with their ESB (English Speaking Background) peers. Obviously, this difficulty impacts negatively on their participation in group assessment projects commonly used at our university. Many NESB students find it difficult to participate in the meetings which are an essential part of group projects and often feel sidelined or belittled particularly by their ESB counterparts. We discuss possible reasons for this state of affairs and make suggestions as to how EAP (English for Academic Purposes) lecturers can prepare NESB students to become more successful in their interaction in group projects.\nThis is the author's version of the final published article (see details above)."}

Also losing a race would be Darlington (S.C.) Raceway, leaving it with just one race.\nFrance said the NASCAR Busch Series schedule would also be realigned to reflect the changes made to the Nextel Cup Series.\nThe announcement of the new race for Texas Motor Speedway, which had been rumored for weeks, was a direct result of a settlement of a lawsuit brought on by a SMI shareholder, Francis Ferko, who sued NASCAR saying the sanctioning body reneged on a promise to give Texas Motor Speedway a second race date.\nUnder the settlement, SMI would purchase North Carolina Speedway from NASCAR’s sister company, International Speedway Corporation, and the race date would move to Texas Motor Speedway.\nNASCAR also announced that Darlington Raceway, the first superspeedway to host a NASCAR race, would lose one of its two races, which would move to Phoenix International Raceway.\nThe realignment leaves the Carolinas, which at one time hosted over 25 races a season, now left with just three races.\nBoth tracks remote locations, as well as their failure to regularly sell-out events held at the track, ultimately sealed their fate.\nDuring the NASCAR media tour in January 2003, then NASCAR Chairman Bill France Jr. announced that four tracks were being studied for possible realignment – Atlanta Motor Speedway, Lowe’s Motor Speedway, Rockingham and Darlington.\nBill France, Jr. said at that time that race dates might be moved within their own companies, prompting the sale of North Carolina Speedway to SMI.\nNorth Carolina Speedway has been part of the NASCAR schedule since 1965, and had hosted two races a year since 1966 until NASCAR realigned the schedule last year, moving Darlington’s traditional Labor Day weekend race to California Speedway and moving North Carolina Speedway’s fall race to Darlington.\n“I'd say we're disappointed the events didn't work as well as they work in California and other markets,” Brian France said. “I would say that there's plenty of good NASCAR racing right here in Richmond, in the Southeast. I would tell you there's plenty of opportunities for our fans in the Southeast to see the sport that they love the most, which is NASCAR.\nSMI Founder and Chairman O. Bruton Smith has been seeking a second date for Texas Motor Speedway since the track opened in 1997. At that time, NASCAR didn’t have a slot on the schedule for TMS, so Smith and New Hampshire International Speedway owner Bob Bahre, each purchased half of the North Wilkesboro Speedway and closed the track, then moved the tracks two races to TMS and NHIS.\n“We are very pleased to have reached the settlement agreement and to have obtained a second NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series date for Texas Motor Speedway,” said Smith. \"The second Texas date falls in line with NASCAR's overlying strategy of expanding into underserved markets and will help strengthen the sport's national appeal.\n“My desire, as it has always been, is to continue to help NASCAR build the sport of stock car racing. Working together will help build a better sport for the fans, participants and corporate partners,” Smith concluded.\nNASCAR also announced that NASCAR’s annual all-star race, the NASCAR Nextel All-Star Challenge, would remain at Lowe’s Motor Speedway in 2005.\nIt was also announced that ISC would purchase Martinsville Speedway, possibly putting that track's race dates in jeopardy.\n“The realignment is going to continue,” France said.\nNorth Carolina Speedway will not be on the schedule in 2005.\nPhoenix International Raceway’s second date will be a Saturday night affair, held on April 23rd.\nTexas Motor Speedway’s second race will be held on Nov. 6 in 2005, making that race part of “Chase For The Championship”.\nDarlington’s only remaining race will be held on Saturday night, May 7, the day before Mother's Day, which has traditionally been an off-day for the Nextel Cup Series.\nCalifornia Speedway would keep its two races.\nThe Nextel All-Star Challenge will remain at Lowe’s Motor Speedway for 2005."}

Despite suffering an overall 77 percent vacancy rate, however, the center’s owners received an assessment based on a property value of $5,337,400.\nThe shopping center’s owners protested. They asserted that the assessed value of the property exceeds 50 percent of the true cash value. But a tax tribunal, after reviewing the matter, agreed with local assessors. The tribunal found that at the time of the assessment the overall shopping center occupancy rate in the area surrounding Pipestone Plaza was 10 percent and that Pipestone Plaza’s vacancy problem was not due to any defects in the property itself.\nOn appeal to Michigan’s courts, the center’s owners argued that the tax tribunal erred. They contended that the valuation used faulty methodology by failing to consider the actual vacancy rate of the property.\nIn Michigan, however, the courts cannot reverse a tax tribunal’s fact findings unless the tribunal did not support those findings with competent, material, and substantial evidence."}

MAC students concentrating in ERM can leverage NC State’s reputation and brand in ERM to explore career opportunities with large firms who have developed practice lines in risk advisory, or can take on risk management career opportunities in corporate and government sectors.\nRisk management is becoming an expected core competency of all individuals who seek to be in executive leadership positions. Businesses are assigning the “ownership” of certain risks to business unit leaders throughout the organization, holding them accountable for the management of those risks within their areas of responsibility. Thus, if you aspire to ultimately be in a leadership position within an organization you will benefit from formal training related to enterprise risk management.\nMost of the major professional service firms including each of the “Big Four” firms—Deloitte, Ernst & Young, KPMG, and PricewaterhouseCoopers— and national and regional firms—Grant Thornton, RSM McGladrey, BDO, Cherry Bekaert—have well developed risk management advisory practices. Our contacts at these firms report that this is a rapidly growing practice area, and they will be expanding staff devoted to these practice lines over the next few years. But, perhaps your interest is to pursue a career in auditing or tax. The ERM curriculum helps provide auditors an important strategy and risk foundation that they will draw upon in an audit or tax engagement.\nThe Enterprise Risk Management Initiative at NC State is recognized globally for its thought-leadership regarding this important topic. The Initiative’s website receives over 190,000 visits per year, consistently high in Google searches related to ERM, and our faculty are highly regarded internationally for their ERM expertise.\nPlease visit the Initiative’s website, www.erm.ncsu.edu to learn more about ERM and the ERM Initiative at NC State University."}

When performed by an experienced veterinarian, annual check-ups can often result in the early diagnosis of health conditions, which can then be treated before they impact your cat’s quality of life.

He added that part of the website’s importance stems from its role in the decision-making process of prospective students.\nFalzone said the discovery phase of the project will begin on Nov. 12. During this phase, the two firms, mStoner and bvk, will meet with student leaders, Faculty Senate executive committee members and staff members who manage web content for their respective colleges within PNW.\n“Input from students, faculty, staff, alumni and the community, as well as analysis of our peer and competitive institutions, will form the basis for updating the website and brand platform,” Falzone said."}
{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "(ARA) - When you think of prime wedding months do May and June spring to mind? You might be surprised to learn that October and November are also popular months for nuptials. When you realize autumn brings not only cooler weather, but less busy caterers or wedding venues, the season's appeal is easy to understand.\n\"Many brides cash in on fall's ample sunshine and cooler temperatures by holding their weddings outside,\" says Ray Miller of My Wedding Reception Ideas.com. \"An outdoor wedding celebrates the season and plays to another popular trend - eco-awareness.\"\nIn many areas of the country, autumn brings less heat and rain. Plus, saying your \"I do's\" outside, surrounded by fall's vibrant hues, makes Mother Nature your co-decorator.\nIf you're considering having your wedding outside, don't overlook unusual venues. Municipal parks, national parks, botanical gardens, fruit orchards and even zoos can all be fun and interesting places for a wedding.\nThe colors and spirit of fall can also inspire your accessories and decor. Rustic materials and touches like raffia, twigs and straw can add seasonal flair to decorations. Leaf motifs and autumnal hues can be used to adorn everything from cake cutting sets and table linens to table centerpieces and slipcovers.\nYou can even tie your theme to fall holidays like Halloween or Thanksgiving. Leaf-shaped votive holders, personal-size pumpkins and other Halloween wedding favor ideas can add seasonally appropriate fun to your celebration.\nA fall wedding also opens up opportunities to create memorable menus that play on the flavors of the season. Just as spring and summer wedding menus benefit from the season's fresh produce, you can incorporate the fruits of the fall harvest into your autumn nuptials.\nFall vegetables like pumpkin, butternut squash, beets, carrots and rutabagas can be served slow-roasted for a side dish that capitalizes on the season's most colorful and nutritious offerings. Greens such as spinach, endive and celery root come into season in autumn and can be incorporated into soups and salads for a pop of flavor and vitamins.\nMain course choices also open up in fall, when great game comes in season. Replacing boring beef with venison or mundane chicken with pheasant not only puts a seasonal stamp on a menu, but creates a culinary experience wedding guests will remember."}

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "We are joining hands with parents who have children in the black community to give them this message- we are providing them with the village to help raise their children.\nOur \"Mentorship Program\" is the cornerstone of our organization. It encompasses traditional mentee/mentor elements, along with groundbreaking components. We effectively expand the parental role by surrounding young people in the black community with a full-time, hedge of protection, love and support -- from the time they wake up, until they go to bed.\nIn order for our young to truly learn, prosper and grow, they must feel safe in their community. Therefore, ABC Foundation mentor program offers four \"levels\" of involvement. Whether it's 5 minutes a week, or 40 hours a week we have a level that fits your schedule.\nSimple things we do as adults can have a powerful and positive effect on a young life. Ten minutes of your time a week may save a young life. Your time will help build a better black community for next generation.\n\"Level 1\" Mentor Program requires a minimum of 5 minutes of your time a week. The program is simple: You log-on to any of your internet connected devices (phone, tablet, laptop, or desktop) for a few minutes each week, and give advice to a young person and/or answer questions they may have about a particular occupation, or life problem that you have experience with.\n\"Level 2\" Mentor Program was created with the caring but extremely time pressed person in mind. This level requires a minimum of one hour a week giving youth advice and answering their questions online, with the commitment to meet once a month with one youth a month in person in our program offices, or at their home.\n\"Level 3\" Mentor Program is a traditional mentor level of commitment. You either be assigned a mentee or the mentor will choose their mentor. ABC Foundation will give you all the tools and guidance you need to be an effective mentor in the life of a child, this includes topics to discuss, suggested activities, events and organized field trips. There's online engagement, and our office will be open for scheduled meetings.\n\"Level 4\" Mentor Program (or \"Mentor Army\" as we call it), is a new intense mentoring model, where the mentor works with assigned youth on a full time basis -- augmenting or shadowing the parent(s). You'll effectively be a child's parent or guardian outside of their household in the streets, which is the toughest yet missing and needed component of all. Together with the parent(s) we will access the child's needs and challenges, and design a specific game plan to essentially surround him/her with a blanket a love and protection. This may even require walking a child to and/or from school, or even to the mall or the corner store. The goal is to let the child and the neighborhood know will have protection around him or her -- and that they are safe to learn, grow, and be successful. Mentors on this level have to eat, live, be successful, and grow themselves as well. For this reason, our \"Level 4\" Mentors will be offered pay and benefits -- along with an opportunity to receive ownership in the for-profit businesses that our sister, for-profit organization, ABC Real Estate & Business Development.\nto make our mentor program mandatory for youth living starting with Long Beach.\nWe will also market directly to displaced or disenfranchised youth, providing strong incentives (educational grants, training, job placement, & housing) for them to sign up voluntarily.\nWe will work with the same individuals, groups, and organizations above to recruit caring mentors. We will also market directly to black professionals online and offline, encouraging them to join the team and help make a difference. See below for our specific screening process for mentors to ensure that they are properly qualified and equipped.\nTo ensure the best service and have the maximum positive effect in the community, we're partnering with \"MENTOR\", a well established, \"National Mentoring Partnership\". This is an alliance with between many mentoring organizations across the United States. Please read information below and on the \"MENTOR\" website at www.mentoring.org for more information on our mentoring format, recruitment, screening/background checks, training, administration, and program controls.\nPreliminary research suggests that there are substantial differences in the success of mentoring programs based on the length of the relationship, the needs of the mentee, the frequency of the interaction, the quality of the relationship between mentor and mentee, and the organization and structure of the program. Successful mentoring programs relies on the balance of the mentor-mentee relationship and the structure and organization of the mentoring program as a whole.\nRecruit appropriate mentors and mentees and ensure clear expectations for the program. Because mentoring relationships can vary with the type of program, it is important that both mentors and mentees have a clear understanding of the program’s expectations. For mentors it is important that they have a realistic expectation of the benefits and challenges associated with mentoring. It is also important that the needs of the youth recruited for the program match the services that the program can provide. Eliminating mismatches between mentor and mentee expectations can help diminish the chance that the mentoring relationship ends prematurely, and ensure that it is a positive experience for both the mentor and the mentee.\nConduct reasonably intensive screening of potential mentors. MENTOR suggests that the screening process include an application, time commitment of at least one year and one face-to-face meeting per week, a face-to-face interview, a reference check, and a criminal background check. MENTOR also suggests that mentees should be screened. This includes parents or guardians filling out an application, providing consent, and committing to participate in the program for at least a year through the schedule designed by the program.\nResearch on mentors participating in BBBS showed that mentors receiving less training prior to being matched with their mentee, specifically less than two hours, had less positive mentoring relationships. These mentors reported that they did not feel as close with their mentees, spent less time with them, and were less likely to continue the relationship the following year compared to mentors who had received two or more hours of training prior to beginning the mentorship. (Herrera, Sipe, & McClanahan, 2000).\nMake matches based to encourage sustained relationships. MENTOR suggests that characteristics of the mentor-mentee should be considered during the matching process.\nOffer continuous support and training to mentors that extends post-match. While initial training can be helpful for mentors, continuous ongoing support is also essential. MENTOR suggests that programs contact mentors and mentees at least twice a month during the initial month of the relationship and at least monthly after that. Programs should also provide mentors with resources such as experts, publications, connections with experienced mentors, and social service referrals to help address challenges that they may face during the mentoring relationship, and at least one or more opportunities for training following the initial training. MENTOR also suggests using evidence-based evaluations and assessments to assess the relationship.\nThough practice and research suggest some best practices for mentoring programs, it is important to recognize that the needs children and youth face are unique to their circumstances. Programs designed for them are most effective when the needs of the mentees are taken into account and factor into the structure of the program and the pairing of mentors and mentees."}

I eat as many ice creams as I can get my hands on and more than make up for all the iced delights I never eat on home turf. If you love ice cream, you’re going to love San Francisco, it really is an ice cream lover’s delight.\nFor me, a visit to San Francisco is not a visit to San Francisco without a visit to Swensen’s. This is the ice chain’s original store and it’s been serving cones of delight since 1948.\nIt’s worth walking up hills to the place “where happiness never melts.” I think Olaf would approve! There’s no seating and no scoops on show, just grab your cone, cup or sundae and go.\nHere you’ll find a choice of 24 homemade ice creams and cookies like grandma used to make, plus really friendly staff to boot. If you want something more creative than a cone, you can opt for a custom ice cream sandwich or sundae instead, there are heaps of cookies and toppings to choose from. You can try before you buy and although there are no seats in the compact, modern interior, there are plenty of tables outside which are the perfect place for a spot of people watching and, if you’re lucky some free street entertainment.\nA visit to this old skool ice cream shop and candy store is a treat, and that’s without even taking a taste! Go inside and take a step back in time with ice cream, candies and service from today and yesteryear.\nTom the owner is as sweet as the ice cream he scoops and is happy to let you sample. The candies and ice cream flavours on offer are mind bogglingly good. It’s just like the good old days only better!\nSmitten is a scoop apart from other creameries because they use liquid nitrogen to freeze each scoop to order! There’s a menu but no ice cream at the counter, so once you pick your flavour, your Brrrista pours fresh cream into the Brrr machine and then the magic happens, right there in front of you! Apparently, Smitten’s founder, Robyn Sue Fisher worked with a retired aero-space engineer to design and build the first version of the Brrr, the space age machine that freezes the ice cream – it’s really is super cool in every sense.\nIn just a couple of minutes, you’ll be eating fresh, creamy and uber delicious ice cream, ideally in one of the homemade waffle cones that are made in house and fresh every day and are utterly delicious! There’s limited seating inside and a cute little courtyard where you can savour your scoop. This place has it all, a cool store, friendly staff and quality ingredients – this is one scoop you won’t want to miss!\nIf you hear someone talk of San Francisco and ice cream in the same sentence, the name they’re likely to drop is Humphry Slocombe. This San Fransiscan ice cream institution is famous for it’s wacky but wonderful flavour combinations. Located in the Ferry Building, a scoop of Slocombe is just the ticket after a day on the bay.\nIn store you’ll find a long line and a dozen diverse flavours but I’m an ice cream conservative so I played it safe with Peanut Butter Swirl. As delicious as it was, I have frozen FOMO because my SF friends tell me a signature scoop of Secret Breakfast – with bourbon, yes bourbon, and cornflakes – is not to be missed. Whatever flavour you get, take your ice cream outside and enjoy it with a bayside view!\nLocated in a side street just off the strip that is Fisherman’s Wharf, this open air cafe has something for everyone – from ice cream sandwiches to sundaes and cookie bowls to floats.\nThere’s 13+ ice creams to choose from but the ice cream sandwiches are the star of the show here, you can customise your combo with cookies, donuts or brownies! There’s a ton of toppings on offer and you can even get your sandwich hot pressed too! The staff are friendly and there’s some outside seating which is always a bonus.\nAt one of the bricks and mortar stores of this local chain, you’ll find a delicious dozen of organic ice cream flavours. There’s nowhere to sit, so just grab your cone (or take a tub) and go.\nHere you’ll find scoops that are spun in Oakland and served in San Fran in the heart of the financial district. Billed as the smallest scoop shop in America, it’s certainly cosy and serves twelve tantalising and really rather offbeat flavours, ranging from Vegan Thai Green Curry to Hot Buttered Rum.\nThere are plenty of vegan options, sorbets and there’s even pup pops, so that your dog can get the inside scoop too! The store is too small for seats, but you can perch on the multicoloured stools outside on Claude Lane.\nOnce an outpost of a Hawaiian chain, Lappert’s now manufactures it’s ice cream in Richmond, California. Here in the heart of Sausalito, you’ll find long lines, brisk service and a whole range of fabulous flavours. As well as scoops, there’s also shakes, sundaes and sandwiches and sugar free and frozen yoghurt options too.\nAre you an ice cream lover too? What’s your favourite flavour? Have you got any San Franciscan ice cream that I must add to the list? What’s the one food you can’t get enough of when you go overseas?"}

For those wondering, the word is pronounced \"fuh\" (rhymes with \"duh\") and as Frank Kocis pointed out in his Pho Linh review , there are probably more pho joints in the city than there are opinions about them.\nThe origin of pho is hotly debated among pho fanatics. Some theorize that although the Vietnamese valued cows more as beasts of burden rather than their meat, the French occupation of Hanoi in the mid-1880s had an influence on local cuisine. Others insist that the French had nothing to do with it, but that the Chinese alone invented the dish.\nWhatever the history, there's no denying the appeal of a savoury bowl of pho. I order the most basic pho selection on the menu: P1 House Special Beef with Noodle (see photo at top), $6.25 for a \"small\" bowl (quotes because of the generous serving). The broth is flavourful and beef tender, served with bean sprouts garnished with Thai basil.\nI haven't had much experience with pho (or eating connective tissue in general), so don't recognize tripe.\nME: \"Ooo, this is an interesting kind of noodle!\"\nMY FRIEND: \"Um, that's not a noodle.\"\nMF: \"I'll tell you after you try some.\"\nI take a tentative bite. A bit rubbery and bland, but I suspect it's an acquired taste. I also try a piece of gristly tendon, reminding myself that tripe and tendon are important elements in good pho.\nWe order the spring rolls appetizer (A6, $4.50 for small), and they're amazing: crisp (not tough or overly chewy) on the outside, savoury inside, with a tasty dipping sauce.\nThe strawberry shake ($3.99) is refreshing, sweet and light. I'd come back in a heartbeat for just the shake and spring rolls.\nHe lets me sample, and I decide I'm going to order this next time I visit.\nThe ground pork rolls are good, but the slices of Vietnamese sausage look and taste like bologna to me.\nA tip for those looking for a place for quiet conversation: make sure you get a table as far from the kitchen area as possible, where noise from the blender can be distracting.\nIf you're in the mood for more pho, do check out blogTO's reviews of Pho 66 , Pho 88 , Pho Hung , Phi Linh , Golden Turtle and Pho Phuong ."}

{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "As I talked about in my earlier posts, I am really interested in learning about the Japanese methods of teaching math concepts. As I was exploring a 1st grade Japanese textbook that Phil Daro recommended, I noticed something I wanted to field test. The textbook had the students placing counters on top of the pictures to help them count. Brilliant!! This would help the students keep track of what they counted and keep their hands engaged–which is very important, especially in kindergarten. So I connected with two kindergarten teachers and wrote an activity for a center.\nStudents look at a picture and find something to count.\nStudents count and place counters on the object they are counting.\nStudents move the counters to the ten frame.\nStudents fill in the sentence frames to support communication about the number.\nLesson 1: Students need multiple access points.\nAll classrooms have diversity in students’ prior knowledge and ability to process the lesson. In order to challenge those that need challenging and scaffold for those who need scaffolding, we have to create different access points for students.\nAs I worked with the students they were slowly starting to see the pattern with the ten frame. They had never used them, so at first the students were just counting the counters and then counting the empty spaces to answer the questions. It felt like they were just filling in another blank. I wanted them to be able to communicate about the ten frame, so I made a second adjustment. I wrote the questions as sentence frames with blanks to fill in. This was a great adjustment because we would read the sentences together and now the students were building their math, language, and reading! This was my second lesson learned.\nLesson 2: Students need to be given sentence frames initially.\nGetting students to talk about math doesn’t always come naturally. A great way to support reading and math is to write sentence frames. The students fill in the frames and read them! Click on the Ten Frame to download your copy.\nI love being in classrooms and watching how students think! Common Core is asking us to be so much more thoughtful about how we communicate and develop the math for students. It needs to make sense and be full of connections so they see the beautiful patterns all over mathematics. It can no longer be magic. It needs to make sense!
