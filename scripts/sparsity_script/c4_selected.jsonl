{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "We held a public exhibition earlier this month to consult with members of the local community regarding the proposed development of up to 130 high-quality houses in Eccleshall. Attended by over 140 members of the community, including local residents, Parish Councillors and businesses, we were able to hear concerns of how the proposed development on Stafford Road, to the rear of Badgers Croft, would affect the local community.\n• The proposed vehicle through-route from Stafford Road to Badgers Croft.\n• Whether the benefits of the affordable housing would be for local people.\n• The effects on the town’s infrastructure, including the capacity of sewerage networks and local schools.\n• The impact on the amenity and views for existing residents living on Badgers Croft and Stafford Road.\nWe are now responding to feedback by addressing the issues raised through proposed amendments to the proposal, which it will present at the Eccleshall Parish Council Planning Meeting to be held at the Broughton Parish Rooms on Wednesday 16th April.\n• No vehicle access through to Badgers Croft. Badgers Croft will therefore only be used for pedestrian and cyclist access, so that existing and new residents can easily and safely access the new public play space and open spaces.\n• The main point of access from Stafford Road is now proposed as a roundabout solution, which will have wider safety benefits for existing residents by slowing speeds on this stretch of road.\n• Plans include first refusal on affordable housing for local residents and family members of Eccleshall Parish, which is not a standard approach in the industry, but means that the needs of local people are met before these properties are offered to other people from nearby parishes or the wider Borough.\nPaul Campbell, director of Richborough Estates said: “We have listened carefully to the feedback from local people in Eccleshall and have revised our proposed plans to make sure they take into account the feedback we have received and to ensure that they are genuinely beneficial to people living in the town.\nIf the proposed development is approved, it will deliver much needed new market and affordable housing in key services villages as outlined in the emerging Plan for Stafford Borough. This will include a mix of housing types, ranging from affordable bungalows to two bedroom starter homes andfive bed family homes.\nA total of 40% of the development, or up to 52 dwellings, will be affordable housing. We will also be responsible for making any necessary improvements to the community infrastructure, such as educational, highways and other improvements as deemed fit by the local authority and the Parish Council’s Neighbourhood Planning Group."}
{"max_tokens": 0, "prompt": "We have long recommended WPML as a great way to translate WordPress pages. Now, the WPML team have released a substantial update, allowing users to translate Elementor pages and posts in a much easier way than ever before.\nWPML is one of the most popular translation plugins and has been around since 2009. In fact, it’s one of the most popular commercial plugins as well, with over 400,000 WordPress sites using it to translate their content.\nIn its latest feature release, WPML has released a page builder addon, allowing users to translate the entire page they’ve made in Elementor, including all of its elements, from a single and convenient editor. You can read more about this, with step by step instructions, in WPML’s release post.\nIt has now become extremely easy to translate pages with WPML, because you can freely add text to any text widget, and then translate it in the WPML editor. After you finish crafting the entire page, all the widget texts will automatically appear in WPML’s Translation Editor.\nStep 1: Create your page. You can use any of the following widgets: Heading, Text Editor, Video, Button, Icon, Price List, Price Table, Flip Box, Slides, Image Box, Icon Box, Icon List, Counter, Progress Bar, Testimonial, Tabs, Accordion, Toggle, Alert, HTML & Form.\nStep 2: Go to the page dashboard and click on the plus icon next to Translate in the WPML box.\nStep 3: In the translation editor, add your translation to each of the widgets. be sure to check the box to indicate the translation is complete.\nStep 4: Once the translation for all the widgets is complete, the translation bar will show 100% complete. Now you can click on ‘Save and close’.\nYou should now be sent back to the dashboard, with the page, including all widgets, translated with WPML.\nYou can also outsource the translation of the Elementor page using WPML’s translation management. After you add the page to the Translation Basket, you’ll be able to choose the translator that the page will be sent to.\nThat translator will have access to the same translation editor described earlier. Once the translator finishes the job, the page will be available on the site.\nAfter you update a page you have already translated, an update icon will appear in the WPML box in the dashboard of the page, notifying you the translation needs updating. Inside the translation editor, you will see the new heading text and will be able to add the proper translation to it.\nAlmost every Elementor widget contains links. Buttons, Icon box, Images, Tabs and so on… Now, when you add links to any of Elementor’s widgets, WPML automatically updates the links in the translated versions to make them point to translated content.\nWPML stated that they are working on adding the option to translate texts that come from image widgets, as well as other new features coming up.\nAccording to Google Analytics from Elementor.com, approximately 56% of our audience are English speakers. Moreover, English speaking users should also consider creating multilingual sites, in order to reach a broader global audience.\nThese users can greatly benefit from WPML’s latest update. We have gotten a lot of questions about creating multilingual websites with Elementor, so I am sure this updates will be appreciated. I’d like to thank the entire WPML team for significantly upgrading the process of translating Elementor content.\nI think this update says something about the way in which page builders have recently become a crucial element in every WordPress website. We are happy to continue to lead the cause of making web design fun and intuitive in WordPress.\nIf you are looking for free translation plugins that work with Elementor, I suggest you try TranslatePress and Polylang.\nOne final related note. If you speak a foreign language, this is a great chance to contribute to the Elementor project and add an online translation to our page builder.\nREALLY happy with this. Thanks for sharing ben.\nI already tested and work well. Very happy and big thank you!\nMuchas gracias, muy interesante plugin.\nElementor must use wpml? Can not use google translation?\nBecause I was wordpress novice, read a lot of wpml article feel pretty good, but the primary still do not understand, elementor can only have this way to translate it? If you want to set up more languages!\nIs it possible to translate global widgets from Elementor Pro? If yes, how to do this would be great!\nIs this possible, we would also really need this!\nNice! Elementor + Wpml = Awesome.\nHey Ben! Thanks for the article. It’s very clear and useful.\nDoes Elementor work with any other multilingual plugins?\nThat is not entirely true is it? Both global widget as well as animated widgets are not translated at all.\nI don’t see a translation for the video widget URL. Though it’s a special case, video’s can be language specific (voiceover, subtitles) and thus can have different URL’s.\nYou mentioned “heading” but Is the “section heading” widget translatable as well ? Doesn’t seem to be for me.\nwhat if I want different style for my language. I mean different template for each language. I tried to make single template for my pods and translate it but in front-end it’s not change base on selected language. any idea?\nThere is a problem wpml translating multi-lingual templates when using the Astra theme. So when I modify the template of the languages added, the design of the template disappears until I return to save and publish the mother tongue of the template, where everything goes back to its nature .. Why does that happen ..?\nI’m making multilingual website using Elementor+ACF+WPML. I make a frontpage template with Elementor, where I’m use ACF with dynamic field Elementor feature.\nI don’t want to use WPML translation feature for Elementor because it breaks the template logic. WPML creates different pages with different Elementor layouts for each language. When I need to correct design I should do this on each page.\nThat’s why I use ACF. I did page markup with Elementor and its’ dynamic feature, and then fill the fields with the native WordPress editing mode, for each translation.\nThe question is: How is the translation while maintaining this connection between the ACF and My template in Elementor ..?\nOMG, at first glance, a serious mess with Elementor custom templates 🙁 … Does it have to be so complicated (WPML side)… Having to delve into language version for custom templates, and for display conditions… Seems like connections are not being properly made..?"}
